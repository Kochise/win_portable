## Description:

`time` provides utilities for working with time and dates:
- parsing of time values expressed in one of the commonly used standard time/date formats
- formatting of time values
- arithmetic over times/durations
- converting between local time and UTC (timezone support)
- stop watches for accurately measuring time durations
- sleeping for a period of time

## Examples:

```v
import time

println(time.now())
```
