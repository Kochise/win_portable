Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The 'mwe' package has due to its nature a little uncommon installation
requirements.  While the normal package files are installed as normal, a variety
of image files are installed in the 'tex/latex/mwe/' folder, so that they can be
accessed from every (MWE) document.

Multiple binary images are included which can't be build from the DTX alone
without extra conversion tools.  A TDS ZIP file which only needs to be unzipped
over the TEXMF is also provided.  This is the preferred way to install this
package for end users and distribution maintainers.  If a manual build is wanted
change all occurrences of 'nostandalone' to 'standalone' in the DTX file.
Compile all extracted TEX files with pdflatex and convert these files from PDF
to PNG and JPG. Compile again with latex and dvips to create the EPS files
(rename the PS to EPS).

The files should be installed in the following subdirectories of the TEXMF tree.
