[] Add option to auto-copy files from slow source devices (e.g. CD-ROM or

[] Try out a "use minimum speed" instead of "max" when no speeds could be
   retrieved

[] Put project size display in the Size column of dir listing
[] Display estimated remaining free space of project on different 
   media types
[] Rename project pseudo-directories (remove "**")
[] Allow burn and erase windows to be minimized; put % on titlebar
[] Put INI file in the same dir as wincmd.ini for easier multi-user
   installations
[] Add option to use external ASPI driver


DONE in 0.9.2:

[] Support the following further project types:

FoxBurner Wishlist:

[] Burn more than one video track in (S)VCD projects
[] Show contents of imported sessions prior to preparing
   the new project, ability to remove old files
[] Ability to set disc creation date, burning software etc.
[] Ability to set duration of gap between audio tracks
   (current fixed default: 2 seconds)
[] Improve verify...
   It's slow, ejecting the CD causes problem with slot-in or
   notebook drives, sometimes reports errors though there are
   none.
