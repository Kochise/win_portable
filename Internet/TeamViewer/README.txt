TeamViewer Portable
===================

CAVEAT: For using TeamViewer Portable commercially, you require a 
        TeamViewer account with an appropriate license.

This is a complete TeamViewer supporter module that can be directly started
without installation (e.g. from an USB stick). Settings are not saved to
registry.

By setting LogOutgoingConnections=1 in the TeamViewer.ini file you can force TeamViewer 
to write a log file with detailed information about your connections.

By setting importsettings=1 you activate the automatic settings import. TeamViewer 
Portable will import the settings from a file called tv.ini which has to be situated 
in the same directory as your TeamViewer.exe. You can create the tv.ini by exporting 
your settings in the advanced options of the full TeamViewer version.
