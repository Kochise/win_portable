The ``lualatex-math`` package
=============================

This package patches a few commands of the LaTeX 2ε kernel and the ``amsmath``,
``amsopn``, ``mathtools`` and ``icomma`` packages to be more compatible with
the LuaTeX engine.  It is only meaningful if you compile your documents with
LuaLaTeX.

Installation
------------

Copy the files ``lualatex-math.sty`` and ``lualatex-math.lua`` to a place where
TeX can find them.  The documentation is contained in the file
``lualatex-math.pdf``.

To produce the runtime files from the Docstrip source, run ``make``.  To
produce the PDF manual, run ``make pdf``.  To produce and compile a few test
files, run ``make check``.  To compile the manual you’ll need my `custom
documentation class`_.

To install the runtime files in your home TEXMF tree, run ``make install``.  To
install the PDF manual in your home TEXMF tree, run ``make install-pdf``.  The
package includes an AucTeX style file which will be installed in
``~/.emacs.d``.

Usage
-----

Include the package via ``\usepackage{lualatex-math}``.  The package has no
options and no public interface; it applies the appropriate fixes
automatically.  See ``lualatex-math.pdf`` for details.

If you encounter any issues, please report them by means of the `issue
tracker`_.
