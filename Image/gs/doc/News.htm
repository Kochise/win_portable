earlier versions, see the history documents:

<h2><a name="Version9.56.0"></a>Version 9.56.1 (2022-04-04)</h2>
<p> Highlights in this release include:
<ul>
<li>
<p><b>New PDF Interpreter:</b> This is an entirely new implementation written in C (rather than
PostScript, as before). For a full discussion of this change and reasons for it see:
<a href="https://ghostscript.com/pdfi.html">Changes Coming to the PDF Interpreter</a>.
<p>In this (9.56.0) release, the new PDF interpreter is now <em><u>ENABLED</u></em> by default
in Ghostscript, but the old PDF interpreter can be used as a fallback by specifying
<code>-dNEWPDF=false</code>. We've provided this so users that encounter issues with the new
interpreter can keep working while we iron out those issues, the option will not be available in
the long term.
<p>This also allows us to offer a new executable (<code>gpdf</code>, or <code>gpdfwin??.exe</code>
on Windows) which is <i>purely</i> for PDF input. For this release, those new binaries are not included
in the "install" make targets, nor in the Windows installers.
</li>
<li>
<p>Calling Ghostscript via the GS API is now thread safe. The one limitation is that the X11 devices for
Unix-like systems (x11, x11alpha, x11cmyk, x11cmyk2, x11cmyk4, x11cmyk8, x11gray2, x11gray4 and x11mono)
cannot be made thread safe, due to their interaction with the X11 server, those devices have been modified
to only allow one instance in an executable.
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>PSD</code> output devices now write ICC profiles to their output files, for improved
color fidelity.
</li>
<li>
<p>Our efforts in code hygiene and maintainability continue.
</li>
<li>
<p>The usual round of bug fixes, compatibility changes, and incremental improvements.
</li>
<li>
<p>(9.53.0) We have added the capability to build with the Tesseract OCR engine. In such
a build, new devices are available (pdfocr8/pdfocr24/pdfocr32) which render the
output file to an image, OCR that image, and output the image "wrapped" up as a
PDF file, with the OCR generated text information included as "invisible" text
(in PDF terms, text rendering mode 3).
<p>Mainly due to time constraints, we only support including Tesseract from
source included in our release packages, and not linking to Tesseract/Leptonica
shared libraries. Whether we add this capability will be largely dependent on
community demand for the feature.
<p>See <a href="https://www.ghostscript.com/ocr.html">Enabling OCR</a> for more details.
</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="9.55.0_Incompatible_changes"></a>Incompatible changes</h3>
<h4>Included below are incompatible changes from recent releases (the
specific release in question is listed in parentheses). We include these,
for now, as we are aware that not everyone upgrades with every release.</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>(9.55.0) Changes to the <code>device API</code>. This will affect developers and maintainers of
Ghostscript devices. Firstly, and most importantly, the way device-specific "procs" are specified has
been rewritten to make it (we think!) clearer and less confusing. See
<a href="Drivers.htm">The Interface between Ghostscript and Device Drivers</a> and
<a href="https://www.notion.so/artifexsoftware/The-Great-Device-Rework-Of-2021-94092fe1395d4a088b91462f0ca5038a">The Great Device Rework Of 2021</a>
for more details.
</li>
<li>
<p>(9.55.0) The command line options <code>-sGraphicsICCProfile=___</code>, <code>-dGraphicsIntent=#</code>, <code>-dGraphicsBlackPt=#</code>,
<code>-dGraphicsKPreserve=#</code> have been changed to <code>-sVectorICCProfile=___</code>, <code>-dVectorIntent=#</code>, <code>-dVectorBlackPt=#</code>,
<code>-dVectorKPreserve=#</code>.
</li>
<li>
<p>(9.53.0) As of 9.53.0, we have (re-)introduced the patch level to the version number,
this helps facilitate a revised policy on handling security-related issues.
<p><strong>Note for GSView Users: </strong>The patch level addition breaks GSView 5 (it is
hardcoded to check for versions <code>704-999</code>. It is possible, but not guaranteed that
a GSView update might be forthcoming to resolve this.
</li>
<li>
<p>(9.52) <code>-dALLOWPSTRANSPARENCY</code>: The transparency compositor (and related
features), whilst we are improving it, remains sensitive to being driven correctly, and
incorrect use can have unexpected/undefined results. Hence, as part of improving security,
we limited access to these operators, originally using the <code>-dSAFER</code> feature.
As we made "SAFER" the default mode, that became unacceptable, hence the new option
<code>-dALLOWPSTRANSPARENCY</code> which enables access to the operators.
</li>
<li>
<p>(9.50) There are a couple of subtle incompatibilities between the old and new SAFER
implementations. Firstly, as mentioned in the 9.50 release notes, SAFER now leaves
standard PostScript functionality unchanged (except for the file access limitations).
Secondly, the interaction with <code>save</code>&sol;<code>restore</code> operations
has changed. See <a href="Use.htm#Safer">SAFER</a>.
<p><strong>Important Note for Windows Users</strong>:
<br>
The file/path pattern matching is case-sensitive, even on Windows. This is a
change in behaviour compared to the old code which, on Windows, was case
<i>in</i>sensitive. This is in recognition of changes in Windows behaviour,
in that it now supports (although does not enforce) case sensitivity.
</li>
<li>
<p>(9.27) The process of &quot;tidying&quot; the PostScript namespace should have removed
only non-standard and undocumented operators. Nevertheless, it is possible that
any integrations or utilities that rely on those non-standard and undocumented
operators may stop working or may change behaviour.
<p>If you encounter such a case, please contact us (<a href="https://discord.gg/H9GXKwyPvY">Discord<a>,
<a href="https://web.libera.chat/#ghostscript">#ghostscript IRC channel</a>,
or the gs-devel mailing list would be best), and we'll work with you to either find an
alternative solution or return the previous functionality, if there is genuinely no other
option.
</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="9.56.0_changelog"></a>Changelog</h3>
<p>From 9.55.0 onwards, in recognition of how unwieldy very large HTML files can become
(History9.html had reached 8.1Mb!), we intend to only include the summary highlights (above).
<p>For anyone wanting the full details of the changes in
a release, we ask them to look at the history in our public git repository:
<a href="https://git.ghostscript.com/?p=ghostpdl.git;a=shortlog;h=refs/tags/ghostpdl-9.56.0">ghostpdl-9.56.0</a> log.
<p>If this change does not draw negative feedback, History?.htm file(s) will be removed from the release archives.
