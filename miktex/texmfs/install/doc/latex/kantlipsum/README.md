The kantlipsum package spits out sentences in Kantian style provided
by the "Kant generator for Python" by Mark Pilgrim, described in the
book "Dive into Python".

This is version 0.8a of the package

Changes from earlier version:

Support for printing only a few sentences from one paragraph has been added;
the code has been polished.

Version 0.8a fixes a small glitch.
