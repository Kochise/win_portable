<h2><a name="execute">Executing the plugin</a></h2>

<p>Press ALT-F1 or ALT-F2 and switch to <b>Network Neighborhood</b>. You find 
the plugin under <b>CD/DVD Burner</b> there, with a golden CD as icon.</p>

<p><img src="NetworkNeighborhood.png"><br>
<i>The Network Neighborhood listing with the TCBurner plugin</i></p>

<p>Querying the properties of the TCBurner directory (by pressing Alt-Enter) 
will display the <b>About box</b>. Switch to the TCBurner directory, and the 
plugin will be initialized.</p>

<p>Make sure you keep the two DLL files <b>FoxBurner.dll</b> and 
<b>mp3lib.dll</b> in the plugin's directory, as those are needed for 
operation!</p>

<p>The initialization is only necessary <b>once</b> per execution of Total 
Commander. When you switch out of the TCBurner plugin, and re-switch back to it 
later, no initialization is done.</p>


<h2>Plugin operation</h2>

<h3><a name="oper-over">Overview</a></h3>

<p>Since the various functions of the plugin are executed through "pseudo-
directories" and "pseudo-files", you are presented with the following list after 
switching to the plugin directory.</p>

<p><i>"Pseudo" means here that the files and directories listed are not really 
actual files or directories on any data storage device, but merely placeholders 
to perform the various functions of the plugins, or representations of the 
actual files being burned to a media.</i></p>

<p><img src="Main.png"><br>
<i>The main listing of pseudo-files/-directories</i></p>

<p>Depending on what you wish to do, execute the corresponding pseudo-file/switch 
to the corresponding pseudo-directory.</p>

<p>To add files to a burning project, you use the normal Total Commander 
<b>Copy</b> command to create representations of the files to be burned in the 
desired project type pseudo-directory. The writer device you wish to use is 
selected when project assembly is complete, in the Burn Media dialog.</p>

<p>Further functions are invoked through TC's commands like <b>Query 
Properties</b> (Alt-Enter) and <b>View</b> (F3).</p>



<h3><a name="oper-configlocations">Storage of configuration data</a></h3>

<p>To accomodate to the requirements of different (multi-user-)environments, 
TCBurner looks for its configuration data file <b>"tcburner.ini"</b> in multiple 
folders, which are:</p>

<ol>
	<li>[wincmd-ini-path]\tcburner.ini</li>
	<li>[wincmd-ini-path]\tcburner\tcburner.ini</li>
	<li>[plugin-path]\tcburner.ini</li>
	<li>[wincmd-path]\tcburner.ini</li>
</ol>

<p>The first folder where it is found (top-down) is used. If it cannot be found, 
a new file with default settings is created in the first listed folder. This way 
you can put the configuration file in any of the locations listed, either 
manually or through the configuration dialog.</p>

<p>For multi-user environments e.g. it is useful to put the file in the "wincmd-
ini-path", so that each user has its own configuration file, and since the 
plugin directory is probably not writable for all users.</p>

<p>You can move the configuration file at any time, even while the plugin is 
intialized, since each time the file needs to be loaded or saved (and not only 
once upon initialization!), its location is searched for in the described 
way.</p>



<h3><a name="oper-locales">Multi-language support</a></h3>

<p>TCBurner supports <b>multiple languages</b> through "locale"-files. In the 
subdirectory <b>"Lang"</b> under the plugin directory you find (and put) the 
language files, extention ".locale".</p>

<p>Several languages are included in the distribution archive, to create your 
own language file please refer to the example locale file "english.locale" 
(which is not really necessary in the Lang directory since the english language 
is included hardcoded in the plugin file itself).</p>

<p>You can switch to switch to another language in the configuration dialog, 
page "System" (<a href="#oper-config">see here</a>). If you're going to create 
an own language file, it would be nice if you send it to the developer for 
distribution!</p>



<h3>The pseudo-files</h3>

<h4><a name="oper-config">Configuration</a></h4>

<p>Execute this pseudo-file to display the plugin's global configuration 
dialog:</p>

<p><img src="GlobalSettings1.png"><br>
<i>The Global Configuration dialog, page 1</i></p>

<p><b>Use internal ASPI layer</b> - If you have problems with burning devices, 
like incorrect detection of media types, free space, errors during burning or 
finalization or similar, try installing an external ASPI layer and uncheck this 
box.</p>

<p><b>Skip media checks</b> - On some burning devices detection of correct media 
type, status or size may fail. To be able to burn in such cases, you can choose 
to skip these checks here.</p>

<p><b>Locale File</b> - TCBurner supports multiple languages; you can set the 
language to be used here. For further information, <a href="#oper-locales">see 
here</a>.</p>

<p><img src="GlobalSettings2.png"><br>
<i>The Global Configuration dialog, page 2</i></p>

<p><b>Automatically save contents</b> - Using pseudo-file commands you can save 
project contents to HDD and load them again later. If additionally you wish to 
automatically save the current projects' contents each time the plugin shuts 
down and reload them next time you use it, check this box. The contents are 
saved to the same directory where the plugin stores its configuration data file 
(see <a href="#oper-config-locations">here</a>), and the project files are named 
"TCBurnerAutoSaveAudioProject.tcb" and "TCBurnerAutoSaveDataProject.tcb".</p>

<p><b>Support .lst files</b> - If checked, when adding a file with extension 
.lst to a Data project (the file itself, not something from within!), you're 
queried whether you wish to add all files listed instead of the .lst file 
itself.</p>

<p><img src="GlobalSettings3.png"><br>
<i>The Global Configuration dialog, page 3</i></p>

<p><b>Import last session</b> - When checked, upon burning a non-finalized data 
project CD the latest session from the CD is imported before preparing the data 
for the new burning. <b>Attention!</b> This setting does not apply to DVD+/-RW 
media! Such media cannot contain multisession projects and are always 
overwritten when new data is burned to them.</p>

<p><b>Query burn speed</b> - When checked, the available burn speeds for each 
device and media is queried from the burner in the Burn Options dialog. This 
option can be turned off since the speed query can - depending on device and 
media - take quite a while. If turned off burning is always done at maximum 
speed.</p>

<p><b>Use default volume label</b> - If checked, after each burning process the 
volume label of the burned project type will be replaced by the default label 
you set here.</p>

<p><img src="GlobalSettings4.png"><br>
<i>The Global Configuration dialog, page 4</i></p>

<p>Here you can change the location of the plugin's ini file. Please <a 
href="#oper-configlocations">see here</a> for further information. Changing the 
location actually means the config file is moved from its current location to 
the new one.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> Some further options which you will quite probably want to set 
individually for each burning process, like ejecting the media after burning or 
clearing the project after burning, are not set here but in the Burn Media 
dialog.</p>


<h4><a name="oper-erase">Erase Media</a></h4>

<p>To erase a rewritable media, <b>execute</b> this pseudo-file. You will be 
presented with a dialog where you can choose the burning device to use.</p>

<p><img src="EraseMedium.png"><br>
<i>The "Erase Media" dialog</i></p>

<p>Check the <b>complete erase</b> box to perform a full erase (the whole media 
is physically overwritten, which can take a long time). If unchecked, only the 
administrative blocks of the media are erased (<b>fast erase</b>)).</p>

<p><b>Note concerning the progress bar</b>: Since a CD/DVD burner does not 
report actual progress information during an erase process, the progress bar 
shows a timed estimate of the needed duration.</p>

<p>For the first erase process performed on a specific device with a specific 
type of media, a default duration of 30 seconds for a fast erase and 15 minutes 
for a full erase is assumed. If that assumption is incorrect (which is quite 
likely), the progress bar will jump back and forth.</p> 

<p>After each completed erase, the needed time is measured and stored in the 
configuration file, separately for each device/media type combination, so the 
next erase process should display quite accurate duration values.</p>

<p><b>Important:</b> rewritable DVD media (DVD-RW and DVD+RW) do not need to be 
erased before writing new data to them. They're formatted in a special way, thus 
do not support multisession, and are automatically erased each time new data is 
written to them.</p>

<p>You can minimize the erase window during the process, its percentage of 
completion is shown in the title bar and thus in the task bar.</p>


<h4><a name="oper-rescan">Rescan Devices</a></h4>

<p>For people with removable burning devices who started the plugin 
<b>before</b> they plugged their burner in (and are too lazy to restart TC ;) ) 
this command may be quite useful.</p>



<h4><a name="oper-help">Show Help</a></h4>

<p>Executing this pseudo-file will open the documentation HTML file you're 
currently looking at.</p>



<h4><a name="oper-update">Update Check</a></h4>

<p>Executing this pseudo-file checks the TCBurner web page for the most recent 
available version. If a newer version than the one you're currently using is 
available, you'll be queried if you wish to open the web page in your 
browser.</p>


<h3><a name="oper-dir">The pseudo-directories</a></h3>

<p>The main purpose of the pseudo-directories is holding representations of the 
files and directories you wish to burn to the various project types TCBurner 
supports.</p>


<h4><a name="oper-audio">Project: Audio CD</a></h4>

<p>If you wish to burn an Audio CD, "copy" the files you wish to burn to this
pseudo-directory. The following types of files can be burned:</p>

<ul>
	<li>WAV files (uncompressed wave files, 44kHz 16bit PCM)</li>
	<li>MP3 files (MPEG 1 Layer 3 compressed audio files)</li>
	<li>OGG files (Ogg-Vorbis compressed audio files)</li>
</ul>

<p>The file types MP3 and OGG will be automatically decompressed on-the-fly 
while burning (no temporary files are created!).</p>

<p>The audio files are not actually copied anywhere when you "copy" them to the 
Audio CD pseudo-directory, but the files listed there are mere representations 
or links of the files you intend to burn. The list of files to burn is presented 
in the following way:</p>

<p><img src="AudioProject.png"><br>
<i>Example for burning an Audio CD</i></p>

<p><b>Important:</b> Some pseudo-file commands like "Burn Media" or "Clear 
Project" only make sense when the project is not empty, and thus are only shown 
if the project is not empty.</p>

<p>The three-digit number in square brackets in front of the file name denotes 
the <b>track number</b> of this audio file on the CD. The next number in square 
brackets is the <b>estimated duration</b> of the track. "Estimated" because the 
duration is extracted from the file header, and e.g. in case of VBR (variable 
bitrate) MP3s, this duration may be highly incorrect. The displayed <b>file 
size</b> refers to the size in bytes that track will use on the Audio CD and is 
also merely an estimate based on the estimated duration.</p>

<h5>Re-ordering audio tracks</h5>

<p>If you wish to <b>re-order</b> the tracks, you simply need to Execute (press
Return) the track pseudo-file. An input dialog will pop up, where you type the 
desired new track number.</p>

<p><b>Notice:</b> The track number you enter is the position to which you wish 
to move the selected track track <b>before</b> the re-ordering operation . The 
selected track will be inserted <b>before</b> the destination track (i.e. the 
one currently occupying the new number), and all further tracks, starting with 
the new position, will be moved downwards one position. To move a track to the 
end of the list, give it a new track number that is higher than all existing 
track numbers in the project. This may sound a little confusing, but just give 
it a try. :)</p>

<h5>Removing audio tracks</h5>

<p>The Total Commander operation <b>Delete</b> is available for the audio file 
representations here, in order to remove tracks from your burning project.</p>

<h5>Performing further functions through pseudo-files</h5>

<ul>

	<li><b>Burn Media</b>: Execute to invoke the Burn Media dialog</li>

	<li><b>Clear Project</b>: Execute to remove all contents from the project</li>

	<li><b>Estimated Free Space</b>: shows the estimated free space either based 
	on a size preset, or on a media inserted in a device, in the file size 
	column. To set the preset or device to use, execute the pseudo-file (<a 
	href="#oper-mediatype">see here</a> for further information).</li>

	<li><b>Load Project</b>: To load the contents of a project previously saved 
	to disk execute this pseudo-file. Existing contents will be cleared before 
	the new contents are loaded.</li>

	<li><b>Project Size</b>: Shows estimated project size information</li>

	<li><b>Save Project</b>: To save the contents of your project execute this 
	pseudo-file.</li>

	<li><b>Volume Label</b>: Shows the current volume label. Execute the pseudo-file 
	to change the label (a text input dialog will pop up). The volume label is
	stored in the configuration file separately for each project type.</li>

</ul>



<h4><a name="oper-data">Project: Data CD/DVD</a></h4>

<p>If you wish to burn a Data CD/DVD, "copy" the files and directories you wish 
to burn to this pseudo-directory.</p>

<p>The files and directories are not actually copied anywhere when you "copy" 
them to the Data CD pseudo-directory, but the objects listed there are mere 
representations of or links to the objects you intend to burn. Despite that 
fact, the directory tree of a Data CD project looks quite like a normal 
directory. The file sizes are also shown correctly, they're retrieved from the 
actual files at their real position on your HDD or other storage device.</p>

<img src="DataProject.png"><br>
<i>Example for burning a Data CD</i></p>

<p>In this example you see a directory "MP3s" was created, and the first 5 of 
the MP3 files on the left pane were "copied" into that directory, as you can see 
by the total directory size.</p>

<p><b>Important:</b> Some pseudo-file commands like "Burn Media" or "Clear 
Project" only make sense when the project is not empty, and thus are only shown 
if the project is not empty.</p>

<h5>Removing files/directories from the project</h5>

<p>The Total Commander operation <b>Delete</b> is available for the file/ 
directory representations here, in order to remove objects from your burning 
project. The actual files on your HDD are of course not deleted!</p>

<h5>Performing further functions through pseudo-files</h5>

<ul>

	<li><b>Burn Media</b>: Execute to invoke the Burn Media dialog</li>

	<li><b>Clear Project</b>: Execute to remove all contents from the project</li>

	<li><b>Create ISO Image</b>: Execute to write the project to an ISO image 
	file (instead of burning it to a media)</li>

	<li><b>Estimated Free Space</b>: shows the estimated free space either based 
	on a size preset, or on a media inserted in a device, in the file size 
	column. To set the preset or device to use, execute the pseudo-file (<a 
	href="#oper-mediatype">see here</a> for further information).</li>

	<li><b>Load Project</b>: To load the contents of a project previously saved 
	to disk execute this pseudo-file. Existing contents will be cleared before 
	the new contents are loaded.</li>

	<li><b>Project Size</b>: Shows estimated project size information</li>

	<li><b>Save Project</b>: To save the contents of your project execute this 
	pseudo-file.</li>

	<li><b>Volume Label</b>: Shows the current volume label. Execute the pseudo-file 
	to change the label (a text input dialog will pop up). The volume label is
	stored in the configuration file separately for each project type.</li>

</ul>



<h4><a name="oper-image">Project: ISO/CUE Image</a></h4>

<p>If you wish to burn an image file to CD/DVD, "copy" the file to this pseudo-
directory.</p>

<p>Supported are image files of types ISO and BIN/CUE. For ISO, a single file
with extension ISO is required. For BIN/CUE, a small cuesheet file (extension CUE)
is required and the actual image file (extension BIN).</p>

<p>In case of BIN/CUE you need to copy only one of the two files. The other file 
must reside in the same directory as the one you copy, its existance of the is 
verified when you copy.</p>

<img src="ImageProject.png"><br>
<i>Example for burning an image to CD</i></p>

<p>As you can see, the pseudo-file shown in the Image project directory actually 
is a whole path name, reminding you which image file you chose for burning.</p>

<p>Naturally, only one image file is allowed in the Image project. If you "copy" 
another file to the project, it overwrites the one currently present. To be 
accepted as an image file, its extension must be ISO, BIN or CUE, and in case of 
BIN/CUE the respective other file must exist in the same directory.</p>

<p>For BIN/CUE, make sure that the image file matches the media type you're 
going to burn. Otherwise the burning might fail with an error.</p>

<p><b>Important:</b> Some pseudo-file commands like "Burn Media" or "Clear 
Project" only make sense when the project is not empty, and thus are only shown 
if the project is not empty.</p>

<h5>Performing further functions through pseudo-files</h5>

<ul>

	<li><b>Burn Media</b>: Execute to invoke the Burn Media dialog</li>

	<li><b>Clear Project</b>: Execute to remove all contents from the project</li>

	<li><b>Estimated Free Space</b>: shows the estimated free space either based 
	on a size preset, or on a media inserted in a device, in the file size 
	column. To set the preset or device to use, execute the pseudo-file (<a 
	href="#oper-mediatype">see here</a> for further information).</li>

	<li><b>Volume Label</b>: Shows the current volume label. Execute the pseudo-file 
	to change the label (a text input dialog will pop up). The volume label is
	stored in the configuration file separately for each project type.</li>

</ul>



<h3><a name="oper-video">Project: Video DVD</a></h3>

<p>For burning a Video DVD, the plugin assumes that you assembled all the files 
that make up your DVD (IFOs, VOBs and BUPs) in one directory on your HDD. To 
tell the plugin which directory that is, you just need to "copy" any one file 
from that directory to the <b>Video DVD</b> pseudo-directory.</p>

<p><img src="VideoDVDProject.png"><br>
<i>Example for burning a Video DVD</i></p>

<p>As you can see, the pseudo-file shown in the Video DVD project directory 
actually is a whole path name, reminding you which path you chose as your DVD 
project path.</p>

<p>Naturally, only one path is allowed in the DVD project. If you "copy" another 
file to the project, its path overwrites the one currently present. To be 
accepted as a Video DVD project path, the path must contain the file 
"VIDEO_TS.IFO" which is required for all Video DVDs.</p>

<p>Conveniently, this means it is no problem if you simply copy the <b>whole 
directory</b> containing your DVD files instead of switching into it and copying 
a single file. That is because "create directory" commands, which such an action 
would trigger, are simply ignored in Video DVD projects, as well as the actual 
target file name. The only thing that is evaluated is the path in which the file 
you try to copy resides. If that path contains a VIDEO_TS.IFO file, it will do 
nicely.</p>

<p><b>Important:</b> Some pseudo-file commands like "Burn Media" or "Clear 
Project" only make sense when the project is not empty, and thus are only shown 
if the project is not empty.</p>

<h5>Performing further functions through pseudo-files</h5>

<ul>

	<li><b>Burn Media</b>: Execute to invoke the Burn Media dialog</li>

	<li><b>Clear Project</b>: Execute to remove all contents from the project</li>

	<li><b>Estimated Free Space</b>: shows the estimated free space either based 
	on a size preset, or on a media inserted in a device, in the file size 
	column. To set the preset or device to use, execute the pseudo-file (<a 
	href="#oper-mediatype">see here</a> for further information).</li>

	<li><b>Volume Label</b>: Shows the current volume label. Execute the pseudo-file 
	to change the label (a text input dialog will pop up). The volume label is
	stored in the configuration file separately for each project type.</li>

</ul>



<h4><a name="oper-devices">Info: Burning Devices</a></h4>

<p>This pseudo-directory lists all available burning devices with vendor and 
brand name, plus it shows basic information about the media inserted in the 
devices (if any).</p>

<p><img src="DeviceList.png"><br>
<i>List of available burning devices</i></p>

<p><b>Important:</b> for rewritable DVD media (DVD-RW and DVD+RW) no disc status 
(empty, incomplete, complete) is shown because those media are formatted in a 
special way, thus do not support multisession, and are automatically erased each 
time new data is written to them. So there's no real "complete" state for them, 
and often DVD writers do not report their state as "empty" even though they 
are.</p>

<p>You may execute the device pseudo-files or query their properties (by 
pressing Alt-Enter) to open the Device Info dialog. The various information 
shown speaks for itself, see the following screenshots:</p>

<p><img src="DeviceInfo1.png"><br>
<i>Device info dialog, page 1</i></p>

<p><img src="DeviceInfo2.png"><br>
<i>Device info dialog, page 2</i></p>

<p><img src="DeviceInfo3.png"><br>
<i>Device info dialog, page 3</i></p>



<h3><a name="oper-mediatype">Setting the Media Type for free space estimate</a></h3>

<p>All project pseudo-directories show the estimated free space, and in this 
dialog (which you can reach by executing the free space pseudo-file) you set
what the plugin should use as base for the estimate.</p>

<p><img src="MediaType.png"><br>
<i>The Media Type dialog</i></p>

<p>The estimate can be based on a media inserted in the device you choose in the
upper list, and if that is not desired, or the device is empty or busy, the media
type and size you choose below is used as base.</p>

<p>The settings made here are stored separately for each project type.</p>



<h2>Burning the medium</h2>

<h3><a name="burn-options">The burning options dialog</a></h3>

<p>The <b>Burn Medium</b> dialog is invoked by executing the corresponding 
pseudo-file in either one of the burning project pseudo-directories. Notice that 
the necessary pseudo-file only becomes visible when the project is no longer all 
empty, i.e. when at least one file/audio track has been "copied" to it, or a 
valid DVD path has been chosen etc.</p>

<p><img src="BurnMedium.png"><br>
<i>The Burn Medium dialog</i></p>

<p>In this dialog you can set the burning options that you likely will want to 
set individually for each burning process. So for your convenience those options 
are not located in the General Options dialog, but here where you also choose 
the burning device to use.</p>

<p>Notice that not all options are available/applicable for all types of 
projects. E.g. the Verify option is only available for Data projects, the option 
Finalize can only be turned off for Data projects and is always on for Audio CD 
and Video DVD projects and so on.</p>

<p>If activated in the Global Settings dialog, you can choose the desired 
burning speed. Each time the Burn Options dialog is invoked, and each time you 
change the burning device, the available speeds are queried. That is because the 
available speeds do not only depend on the burning device, but also on the media 
inserted. If the Query Burn Speeds option is disabled in Global Settings, the 
Burn Speed combo box only has the option "Max. Speed" available.</p>



<h3><a name="burn-progress">The burning progress window</a></h3>

<p>After all that work, your burning process is finally on its way. :) Its 
progress is shown in the following dialog.</p>

<p><img src="BurningProgress.png"><br>
<i>And there goes the burning...</i></p>

<p>The areas of the dialog should be quite self-explanatory. You can abort
burning or verifying by clicking the <b>Abort</b> button.</p>

<p>You can minimize the burn window during the process, its percentage of 
completion is shown in the title bar and thus in the task bar.</p>
