0.20: 05/03/2011
      Fix spelling errors (issue #58)
      Add a MSC validation phase to check that all the entity names are known
       before rendering is started.  This now also outputs the input line
       number at which a problem was detected e.g.
         Error detected at line 10: Unknown source entity 'xyz'.
	 (issue #62)
      Add width and height attributes to svg output.
         (Thanks hwmaier for pointing this out, issue #63)
      When wrapping words in boxes, hypenate very long words if needed to fit
       the available space.
       (issue #59)
      Fix assertion if ... is placed on the same line as another arc, but
       after the arc has been specified.
      Fix regression where blank lines at the start of input would be
       rejected and parsing stopped.
       (Thanks Bernhard for the report and example)
      Allow output to stdout if - is specified as the output filename.
      Fix opening and closing the output file twice - the dummy output in the
       first layout run now goes to /dev/null (or a temp file on Win32).

0.19: 01/01/2011
      Configure script changes to be more thorough about gdlib and FreeType
       detection.  Also correct problems in configuring for Win32 native.
      Inprove RPM packaging compliance with Fedora packaging guidelines.
      Further gdlib anti-alising workarounds.
      Correct canvas height computation when last arc(s) skip (issue #46).
      Allow input quoted strings to span multiple lines e.g.
         a->b [label="line1
                      line1 too!"];
       (issue #45)
      Add gtksourceview syntax highlighting grammar installed in docs
       (Thanks to NThykier for adding this, issue #51).
      Improve error message output by showing line which caused the problem
       and detect possible parse error due to mis-handling of x- in some
       cases and print helpful note (issue #53).
      Parse UTF-8 byte order mark and print a warning if parsing UTF-8 to
       generate a PNG when configured without FreeType.  Otherwise ignore
       the BOM (issue #7).
      Add support for 'note' arcs which draw a box with the corner turned down.
      Enable box arc names to be in upper or lower case in the input file.
      Add word wrapping for arc labels in boxes.  Wrapping for all arc labels
       can also be enabled with the new "wordwraparcs" msc attribute.
       (issue #45)
      Fix rendering of different sized boxes when using parallel arcs.
       (issue #50)
      Improve background to boxes to make it correctly fit abox, rbox
       and note types.
      Improve rounded corners in SVG output.
      Improve vertical layout.
      Make arcskip land an arc where a subsequent arc would start.
      Ensure eps file BoundingBox is given in integer dimensions.
       [Thanks to walter.stanish for the patch]
      Textbgcolour now fills background of box arcs (rbox, abox etc..).
      Fix incorrect use of perror() after fprintf() which may not have
       resulted in the right error being reported.
       (issue #57, thanks Neils!)

0.18: 30/08/2010
      Fix bad strncat() use allowing possible overrun.
       Thanks to ensc42 and Neils for finding this.
      Fix multi-line labels causing multiple dividers ("---")
       Thanks to llucax for the report, issue #31.
      Add support for arrowless arcs and bi-directional arrows as requested
       by xmlscott and started by Niels.  Can now use arrows such as <->, <=>
       for bidirectional arrows, --, ==, .. etc... for arcs without arrows.
       Issue #29.
      Fix text rendering over the box edge in multiline labels.
      Add patch to honour linecolour in boxes, issue #33.
       Thanks to Neils for this patch.
      Add 'textbgcolour' and 'arctextbgcolour' attributes to set the
       background colour for text in an entity or on an arc.
      Add support for -X and X- arcs which indicate a lost message.
      Add support for a new 'arcskip' attribute which allows an arc to have
       an additional slant to show delays or similar.
      Change configure.ac to attempt to use gdlib-config and then pkg-config.
       This enables simpler configuration/build on platforms where gd hasn't
       been updated to supply a pkg-config file e.g. Cygwin.  Update README
       regarding building on Cygwin and progress the cygport.

0.17: 31/08/2009
      Change the command line parser so a space is not needed to split
       switches from the value e.g. -Tpng is now acceptable.
      Take input filename as last parameter if it doesn't match any switches.
      Default output filename is <input filename>.<output type>.
      The above changes now make it possible to use #!/usr/bin/mscgen -Tpng
       at the top of a script to cause mscgen to process it directly.  The
       usual restrictions apply (file must be exectutable, Unix format etc..)
      Correctly handle multi-line C comments, issue #16.
       [Thanks Neils for reporting this one]
      Collapse parser and renderer together and bring man/ and test/ up a
       level.  Parser and renderer and now both under GPLv2.
      Change build system to use autotools.  Also add examples with an install
       target too.
       [Many thanks to Neils for his hard work on this contribution]
      Add COPYING notice and credits for libgd according to their licence.
      Remove the win32 version of gd from the packaging, and use pkg-conf to
       file/setup build for libgd.  Also add --without-png option to configure.
       [Again, thanks to Neils for suggestions and patches on this]
      Fix ignoring of arc line colour attribute unless a text colour was also
       given, issue #23.
       [Thanks to dunbar.ian for reporting, Neils for finding the bug]
      Apply patches to simplify installation of examples and increase install
       portability, issue #27.
       [Thanks chickenandpom for this patch]
      Ensure docs install under mscgen.

0.16: 28/06/2009
      Fix segfault on malformed input, issue #10.
       [Thanks Neils for reporting and providing a fix]
      Replace flex default rule so that it will not echo unknown characters.
       Instead it returns an unknown token to the parser which then stops
       and warns about the erroneous input line.
      Match \r\n, \r and \n line endings to count input line numbers.
       [Both thanks to Neils]
      Fix error in GPL address for utf8.c/h.
      Fix for spaces (|||) and dividers (---) on lineswhich have ","
       at the end causing an assert to fail.
       [Thanks to Neils and jahagirdar.gopal for reporting]
      Add FreeType support under USE_FREETYPE, although disabled by default
      Add anti-alising to some lines.
      Increase row heights when text is more than 2 lines long and size boxes
       accordingly.  [Thanks to ronaldpwilson for reporting this one]

0.15: 23/05/2009
      Escape special characters for SVG output.
      Better UTF8 support in SVG and PS output.
      Add Wall Wextra and fixup warnings.
      Add ability to place multiple boxes on the same line using ","
       instead of ";".
      Clean up Makefiles a little and add install target.
      Update libgd to 2.0.34.

0.14: 27/02/2009
      Added state description boxes into the entity lines.
      Use command "<entity> box <entity> [label="..."];" for state boxes.
       "abox" and "rbox" also work for rounded and angular boxes.
      Fix arc drawing for SVG which was un-noticably mirrored.
      Add all-freebsd target.
       [Thanks to Titus von Boxberg for the initial state box support]

0.13: 27/10/2008
      Fix colour output for postscript.
      Fix scaling for Postscript bounding box; now matches image scaling.
       [Thanks Klaus Wirl]
      Parse empty double-quoted strings (e.g. label="") and allow double
       quotes in strings if escaped (e.g. label="hello\"there").
       [Thanks to Alexei Alexandrov for requesting this]
      Add some info about building on Solaris
       [Thanks to Robert Batusek and Jakub Vavra for helping with this]

0.12: Fix version number being truncated (was reported as 0.1).
       [Thanks to Graham Addis for spotting this]
      Add REMOVE_PNG_OUPUT to allow building without PNG support as a
       workaround for a packaging problem with gd-devel on Fedora 8.
      Add support for textcolour and linecolour attributes on arcs and
       entites.  Add support for double lined arcs.
        [Thanks to Joon Sung Chun for the patch]
      Add support for arctextcolour and arclinecolour attributes on entity
       definitions to allow default colours to be set on arcs originating
       from some entity.
      Change ADraw colour model to RGB.  Allow colours to be specified as
       #rrggbb values, or the 16 W3C HTML names.
      Simplify running of tests under Valgrind e.g.
         VALGRIND="valgrind -tool=memcheck" make test
      Linux builds use pkg-config to get gd dependencies and no longer
       static-link by default.  (Use STATIC=--static make for static objects).
        [Thanks Juliano F. Ravasi for the suggestion]
      Add more string replacements to make parse error reporting relate to
       input and not internal parser token names.
      Add 'width' global option to allow explicit setting of output chart
       width, rather than using a scale factor with hscale.
        [Thanks to Roger Spooner for the suggestion]
      Rename parser.a to libparser.a [Another from Juliano]
      Move CHANGES file up a directory.
      Add arcgradient option to allow arrows to slope, making direction of
       the message to be more clearly observed.
        [Thanks to Roger Spooner for the patch]

0.11: Only render an arc ID on the first line out the label if it has more
       than one line (the ID would previously be duplicated on each line).
      Add support for multi-line entity title labels (use '\n' in the label
       to start a newline).
      Apply changes based on patches from Alban Crequy to support broadcast
       signals, where the destination entity is specified as "*", causing
       arcs to be rendered to all entities.
        [Thanks Alban Crequy for the patch]

0.10: Change sinf() and cosf() to sin() and cos() which are more widely
       supported, particularly SunOS 5.8
        [Thanks to Malay Halder for reporting this]

      Add rendering hint to SVG output to stop aliasing and produce sharper
       output.

0.9:  Remove compiler warnings and use of tempnam() on Unix.
       Add initial SVG support.

0.8:  Extend parser and msc ADT to support global options.
       Add 'hscale' option to allow horizontal scaling of the output.
      Re-check executable is Valgrind clean on Linux, when producing PS
       output.

0.7:  Remove 'else ifeq' in renderer Makefile.
       This requires GNU Make 3.81, which causes problems with older
       installations and Macs.
        [Thanks to Ian Lister]

      Remove printf output after parsing phase as the output isn't
       useful or interesting!

0.6:  Packaging changes only.
       Change source package naming to simplify Gentoo packaging.
        [Thanks Yvan Royon for pointing this out]

       Update copyright notices to 2007.

      Added man page.

0.4:  Ensure that temporary files created during image map generation are
       deleted.

      Clarify some error message and make them distinct.

      Update Win32 version of GD that supplied in the source package.

      Apply a patch from Gavin Shelley to add make commands for Mac OS X.
       [Thanks Gavin!]

0.3:  Add IDURL attribute to allow hypertext superscript strings against
       edges.

      Incorporate patch from Klaus Otto to allow entity headings to support
       attributes too.  [Thanks Klaus!]

0.2:  Clip arc labels positions against left and right edges of output to
       prevent the text being clipped at the image edge.

0.1:  Initial Release
