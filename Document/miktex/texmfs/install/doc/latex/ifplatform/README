The IFPLATFORM package
v0.4a       2017/10/13

This package uses heuristics to establish whether
the document is being processed on Windows or a *NIX
platform (Mac OS X, Linux, etc.).

Except if you're using LuaTeX where this information
is already known. Otherwise, shell escape is required
to differentiate different *NIX platforms.

Booleans provided are:
 - ifwindows
 - iflinux
 - ifmacosx
 - ifcygwin

Finally, the \platformname macro is also provided that
expands to a string of the platform name.
