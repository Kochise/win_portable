This upquote.sty LaTeX package changes the glyphs used by the \verb
and \verb* macros and the "verbatim" and "verbatim*" environments for
ASCII characters 27 and 60 to the "upright quotation mark" and "grave
accent" ones required by Unicode, ISO 646, ISO 10646, and many other
character set standards. This is particularly useful for typesetting
software source code.
