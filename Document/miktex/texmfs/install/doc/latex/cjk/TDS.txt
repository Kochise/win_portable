This is the file TDS.txt of the CJK macro package ver. 4.8.4 (18-Apr-2015).

The TeX Directory Structure (TDS)
---------------------------------

A working group of the American TeX Users Group (TUG) has developed the TDS
standard (available from the CTAN hosts in tex-archive/tds). That document
describes a default directory structure where and how to store the many
different files needed for a complete TeX system.

The following describes the recommended default directories used in the CJK
package for its files; $TEXMF stands for the place where the texmf directory
resides (a possibly better place for distributions based on web2c is
$TEXMFLOCAL; see texmf.cnf of your TeX package for details):

We follow TDS 1.1 and the setup of TeXLive 2005; this corresponds to
kpathsea 3.5.5. Some of the variables don't exist in older kpathsea
implementations---please read the man page of ttf2tfm for more information
on the old locations.


CJK TeX files (you should move the whole `texinput' tree of the CJK package
               to this place):

    $TEXMF/tex/latex/CJK/<CJK subdirs>/<CJK TeX files>

  example:
    /usr/local/web2c-7.0/texmf/tex/latex/CJK/Bg5/Bg5.cap

  affected variable: $TEXINPUTS


TrueType fonts:

    $TEXMF/fonts/truetype/<supplier>/<truetype font>

  example:
    /usr/local/teTeX/texmf/fonts/truetype/arphic/gbsn00lp.ttf

  affected variable: $TTFONTS

  You should append proper entries for all subfonts to special.map to make
  web2c's name parsing algorithm happy (otherwise it can happen that the
  created PK and TFM files are placed into rather strangely named
  directories).

  Example lines to append for the above font:

    gbsnlp01  arphic  gbsnlp
    gbsnlp02  arphic  gbsnlp
    ...


HBF fonts:

    $TEXMF/fonts/misc/hbf/<supplier>/<hbf name stem>/<hbf files>

    [If no supplier is given, you should use `public' instead.]

  example:
    /usr/local/share/texmf/fonts/misc/hbf/public/kanji48/kanji48.{bin,hbf}

  affected variable: $MISCFONTS

  You should append proper entries for all subfonts to special.map to make
  web2c's name parsing algorithm happy (otherwise it can happen that the
  created PK and TFM files are placed into rather strangely named
  directories).

  Example lines to append for the above font:

    kanji4801  public  kanji48
    kanji4802  public  kanji48
    ...


ttf2pk configuration and replacement files (ttf2pk.cfg and *.rpl):

    $TEXMF/ttf2pk

  example:
    /usr/local/texmf/ttf2pk/ttf2pk.cfg

  affected variable: $TTF2PKINPUTS


ttf2pk map files (*.map):

    $TEXMF/fonts/map/ttf2pk

  example:
    /usr/local/texmf/fonts/map/ttf2pk/config/ttfonts.map

  affected variable: $TEXFONTMAPS


ttf2pk encoding files (*.enc):

    $TEXMF/fonts/enc/ttf2pk

  example:
    /usr/local/texmf.local/fonts/enc/ttf2pk/base/T1-WGL4.enc

  affected variable: $ENCFONTS

  [Note that this location is normally found by ttf2tfm also since the
   `ttf2pk' path component doesn't appear explicitly in web2c's $ENCFONTS
   value. Instead, it starts subdirectory searching one level higher.]


ttf2pk subfont definition files (*.sfd):

    $TEXMF/fonts/sfd

  example:
    /home/sx0005/texmf/fonts/sfd/Bg5.sfd

  affected variable: $SFDFONTS


hbf2gf configuration files:

    $TEXMF/hbf2gf/<config files>

  example:
    /dos/texmf/hbf2gf/gsfs14.cfg

  affected variable: $HBF2GFINPUTS


TFM files (<supplier> and <name stem> as specified in special.map):

    $TEXMF/fonts/tfm/<supplier>/<name stem>/<tfm file>

  example:
    /usr/local/teTeX/texmf/fonts/tfm/arphic/gbsnlp/gbsnlp23.tfm

  affected variable: $TFMFONTS


PK files (<supplier> and <name stem> as specified in special.map)

    $TEXMF/fonts/pk/modeless/<supplier>/<name stem>/<pk file>

  example:
    /usr/local/share/texmf/fonts/pk/modeless/uw/uwcxmf/uwcxmf23.3252pk

  affected variable: $PKFONTS

[There are further possibilities how to store PK files:

 1. instead of <name>.<dpi>pk you can use dpi<dpi>/<name>.pk

    example:
      /texmf/fonts/pk/modeless/public/b5ka12/dpi600/b5ka1217.pk

 2. teTeX additionally allows you to omit either <supplier> or <name stem>
    or both (for PK, TFM, and MF files)

    example:
      /texmf/fonts/pk/modeless/b5ka12/dpi600/b5ka1217.pk


 The first option is necessary on operating systems like DOS which only
 allow 8.3 filenames. The second option enables you to use the `!' feature
 of the emTeX subdirectory searching algorithm (only one level) instead of
 `!!' (search all subdirectory levels) together with its template mechanism
 to make emTeX much faster in finding PK files. Now teTeX and emTeX could
 share one common texmf tree.]
