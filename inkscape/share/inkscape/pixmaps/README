Icons follow the freedesktop.org icon scheme. Icons must be placed in
either the "root" level icon directory (share/icons, not recommended)
or a subdirectory which matches one the system installed theme,
i.e. share/icons/hicolor/scalable/actions. Note that 'hicolor' is the
default/backup theme. For the moment, putting all Inkscape icons in
'actions' subdirectory.

Providing an 'index.theme' file or generating an icon cache via
gtk-update-icon-cache does not appear useful.
