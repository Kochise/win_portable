Things to do for the CM-Super fonts (in no particular order):

* INSTALL: miktex: \texmf\miktex\config\config.makepk needs to be configured too? (for YAP)
* generate all missing fonts
* add INF files?
* provide optimized but not hinted version (will be smaller)?
* realize composite glyphs via Type 1 facilities to make the fonts smaller
* include glyphs from TS1 encoding into SC fonts?
  (might be useful for non-TeX applications)
* add glyphs from T2D encoding
* add all other glyphs from LH fonts
* full support for unicode cyrillic codepage
* include glyphs from cbgreek ec-like fonts
* include stroked glyphs from bbm/bbold/doublestroke/AMS fonts
* include glyphs from tipa/cipa/bipa fonts (T3 LaTeX encoding) [sugg. by Berthold Crysmann <crysmann@dfki.de>]
* include glyphs from fc (african) fonts (T4 LaTeX encoding) [sugg. by Berthold Crysmann <crysmann@dfki.de>]
* include glyphs from the vnr family to cover Vietnamese (T5 LaTeX encoding) [sugg. by Werner Lemberg <wl@gnu.org>]
* include all missing glyphs from the Unicode extended Latin sections
* add supplemental math fonts for concrete and bright
* fix bugs in EC fonts which prevent generation of some fonts
* replace some glyphs in EC fonts with better ones
  Euro: cmbright, cbgreek, ...
  numero: LH fonts
  Tcommaaccent: ?
  germandbls: EC (CM)
  Change defaults to use better shapes (with same metrics)
* add new families like bold typewriter, unslanted bold italic
* try to improve glyphs using mf2pt1 package
* will pfaedit give better optimization?
