The MAKECMDS package

    The makecmds package provides several additional commands along
the lines of the traditional \(new|renew|provide)command and friends.
The new \makecommand{\foo}...} is equivalent to the pair of commands
\providecommand{\foo}{}\renewcommand{\foo}...}. There are also
\make... for environments, counters and lengths, and \provide...
for environments, lengths and counters.
