The everypage package extends LaTeX providing hooks to do actions on every page
or on the current page. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, actions are performed before the page is
shipped, so they can be used to put watermarks in the background of a page, or
to set the page layout. The package reminds in some sense bobhook by Karsten
Tinnefeld, but it differs in the way in which the hooks are implemented, as
detailed in the following. In some sense it may also be related to the package
everyshi by Martin Schroeder, but again the implementation is different.

The "everypage" package is copyright 2006-2007
by Sergio Callegari <sergio.callegari@gmail.com>

It comprises this README file, as well as files
everypage.dtx
everypage.ins

To install the package, run LaTeX on the installation script everypage.ins and
follow the instructions provided by the script itself.

NOTE:
--------------
This is version 1.1 of the everypage package.
Version 1.0 had a bug that caused LaTeX to exceed its capacity or to hang.
Such behaviour was particularly evident in conjunction with the draftwatermark
package.

UPGRADE IS RECOMMENDED
