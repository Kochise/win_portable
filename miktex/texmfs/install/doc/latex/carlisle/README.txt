Currently the directory contains the following.

mylatex.ltx
   This file provides a method of making a special format tailored to
   one document, with all the class and packages, and other preamble
   material pre-loaded. This can save quite a lot of time on some
   systems. See the comments in the file.

dotlessj.sty
   If you are using a font set without a dotless j (\j and \jmath) then
   this package will fake one. It requires the LaTeX color package.
   It does not require any explicit PostScript support.

plain.sty
   Typeset plain TeX markup in LaTeX documents.
   Within \begin{plain} ... \end{plain} most plain TeX constructs work
   including commands such as \over which might have been disabled by
   other LaTeX packages such as amsmath.

scalefnt.sty
   \scalefont{2} selects the current font in twice the current size.
   \scalefont{.75} reduces the current font size by three quarters.

slashed.sty
   Commands for the `Feynman slashed character' notation.

ltxtable.tex
ltxtable.pdf
   This generates and documents the package ltxtable.sty. A merger of
   longtable and tabularx packages from the Standard LaTeX tools
   collection. This produces multipage tables in which the column
   widths are automatically calculated to achieve a specified total
   table width.

remreset.sty
   \@removefromreset: a companion to the standard \@addtoreset command
   allows counters to be removed from the reset list of a controlling
   counter. For example, a class file based on book class may say
   \@removefromreset{footnote}{chapter}
   so that footnotes are no longer reset every chapter (the book class
   default).
   This file is obsolete with LaTeX releases from 2018 onwards as the
   command is defined in the format.
