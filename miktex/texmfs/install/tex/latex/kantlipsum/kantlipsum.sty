\__kgl_newpara:n {As any dedicated reader can clearly see, the Ideal of
practical reason is a representation of, as far as I know, the things
in themselves; as I have shown elsewhere, the phenomena should only be
used as a canon for our understanding. The paralogisms of practical
reason are what first give rise to the architectonic of practical
reason. As will easily be shown in the next section, reason would
thereby be made to contradict, in view of these considerations, the
Ideal of practical reason, yet the manifold depends on the phenomena.
Necessity depends on, when thus treated as the practical employment of
the never-ending regress in the series of empirical conditions, time.
Human reason depends on our sense perceptions, by means of analytic
unity. There can be no doubt that the objects in space and time are
what first give rise to human reason.}

\__kgl_newpara:n {Let us suppose that the noumena have nothing to do
with necessity, since knowledge of the Categories is a
posteriori. Hume tells us that the transcendental unity of
apperception can not take account of the discipline of natural reason,
by means of analytic unity. As is proven in the ontological manuals,
it is obvious that the transcendental unity of apperception proves the
validity of the Antinomies; what we have alone been able to show is
that, our understanding depends on the Categories. It remains a
mystery why the Ideal stands in need of reason. It must not be
supposed that our faculties have lying before them, in the case of the
Ideal, the Antinomies; so, the transcendental aesthetic is just as
necessary as our experience. By means of the Ideal, our sense
perceptions are by their very nature contradictory.}

\__kgl_newpara:n {As is shown in the writings of Aristotle, the things
in themselves (and it remains a mystery why this is the case) are a
representation of time. Our concepts have lying before them the
paralogisms of natural reason, but our a posteriori concepts have
lying before them the practical employment of our experience. Because
of our necessary ignorance of the conditions, the paralogisms would
thereby be made to contradict, indeed, space; for these reasons, the
Transcendental Deduction has lying before it our sense perceptions.
(Our a posteriori knowledge can never furnish a true and demonstrated
science, because, like time, it depends on analytic principles.) So,
it must not be supposed that our experience depends on, so, our sense
perceptions, by means of analysis. Space constitutes the whole content
for our sense perceptions, and time occupies part of the sphere of the
Ideal concerning the existence of the objects in space and time in
general.}

\__kgl_newpara:n {As we have already seen, what we have alone been able
to show is that the objects in space and time would be falsified; what
we have alone been able to show is that, our judgements are what first
give rise to metaphysics. As I have shown elsewhere, Aristotle tells
us that the objects in space and time, in the full sense of these
terms, would be falsified. Let us suppose that, indeed, our
problematic judgements, indeed, can be treated like our concepts. As
any dedicated reader can clearly see, our knowledge can be treated
like the transcendental unity of apperception, but the phenomena
occupy part of the sphere of the manifold concerning the existence of
natural causes in general. Whence comes the architectonic of natural
reason, the solution of which involves the relation between necessity
and the Categories? Natural causes (and it is not at all certain that
this is the case) constitute the whole content for the paralogisms.
This could not be passed over in a complete system of transcendental
philosophy, but in a merely critical essay the simple mention of the
fact may suffice.}

\__kgl_newpara:n {Therefore, we can deduce that the objects in space and
time (and I assert, however, that this is the case) have lying before
them the objects in space and time. Because of our necessary ignorance
of the conditions, it must not be supposed that, then, formal logic
(and what we have alone been able to show is that this is true) is a
representation of the never-ending regress in the series of empirical
conditions, but the discipline of pure reason, in so far as this
expounds the contradictory rules of metaphysics, depends on the
Antinomies. By means of analytic unity, our faculties, therefore, can
never, as a whole, furnish a true and demonstrated science, because,
like the transcendental unity of apperception, they constitute the
whole content for a priori principles; for these reasons, our
experience is just as necessary as, in accordance with the principles
of our a priori knowledge, philosophy. The objects in space and time
abstract from all content of knowledge. Has it ever been suggested
that it remains a mystery why there is no relation between the
Antinomies and the phenomena? It must not be supposed that the
Antinomies (and it is not at all certain that this is the case) are
the clue to the discovery of philosophy, because of our necessary
ignorance of the conditions. As I have shown elsewhere, to avoid all
misapprehension, it is necessary to explain that our understanding
(and it must not be supposed that this is true) is what first gives
rise to the architectonic of pure reason, as is evident upon close
examination.}

\__kgl_newpara:n {The things in themselves are what first give rise to
reason, as is proven in the ontological manuals. By virtue of natural
reason, let us suppose that the transcendental unity of apperception
abstracts from all content of knowledge; in view of these
considerations, the Ideal of human reason, on the contrary, is the key
to understanding pure logic. Let us suppose that, irrespective of all
empirical conditions, our understanding stands in need of our
disjunctive judgements. As is shown in the writings of Aristotle, pure
logic, in the case of the discipline of natural reason, abstracts from
all content of knowledge. Our understanding is a representation of, in
accordance with the principles of the employment of the paralogisms,
time. I assert, as I have shown elsewhere, that our concepts can be
treated like metaphysics. By means of the Ideal, it must not be
supposed that the objects in space and time are what first give rise
to the employment of pure reason.}

\__kgl_newpara:n {As is evident upon close examination, to avoid all
misapprehension, it is necessary to explain that, on the contrary, the
never-ending regress in the series of empirical conditions is a
representation of our inductive judgements, yet the things in
themselves prove the validity of, on the contrary, the Categories.  It
remains a mystery why, indeed, the never-ending regress in the series
of empirical conditions exists in philosophy, but the employment of
the Antinomies, in respect of the intelligible character, can never
furnish a true and demonstrated science, because, like the
architectonic of pure reason, it is just as necessary as problematic
principles.  The practical employment of the objects in space and time
is by its very nature contradictory, and the thing in itself would
thereby be made to contradict the Ideal of practical reason.  On the
other hand, natural causes can not take account of, consequently, the
Antinomies, as will easily be shown in the next section.
Consequently, the Ideal of practical reason (and I assert that this is
true) excludes the possibility of our sense perceptions.  Our
experience would thereby be made to contradict, for example, our
ideas, but the transcendental objects in space and time (and let us
suppose that this is the case) are the clue to the discovery of
necessity.  But the proof of this is a task from which we can here be
absolved.}

\__kgl_newpara:n {Thus, the Antinomies exclude the possibility of, on
the other hand, natural causes, as will easily be shown in the next
section.  Still, the reader should be careful to observe that the
phenomena have lying before them the intelligible objects in space and
time, because of the relation between the manifold and the noumena.
As is evident upon close examination, Aristotle tells us that, in
reference to ends, our judgements (and the reader should be careful to
observe that this is the case) constitute the whole content of the
empirical objects in space and time.  Our experience, with the sole
exception of necessity, exists in metaphysics; therefore, metaphysics
exists in our experience.  (It must not be supposed that the thing in
itself (and I assert that this is true) may not contradict itself, but
it is still possible that it may be in contradictions with the
transcendental unity of apperception; certainly, our judgements exist
in natural causes.)  The reader should be careful to observe that,
indeed, the Ideal, on the other hand, can be treated like the noumena,
but natural causes would thereby be made to contradict the Antinomies.
The transcendental unity of apperception constitutes the whole content
for the noumena, by means of analytic unity.}

\__kgl_newpara:n {In all theoretical sciences, the paralogisms of human
reason would be falsified, as is proven in the ontological manuals.
The architectonic of human reason is what first gives rise to the
Categories.  As any dedicated reader can clearly see, the paralogisms
should only be used as a canon for our experience.  What we have alone
been able to show is that, that is to say, our sense perceptions
constitute a body of demonstrated doctrine, and some of this body must
be known a posteriori.  Human reason occupies part of the sphere of
our experience concerning the existence of the phenomena in general.}

\__kgl_newpara:n {By virtue of natural reason, our ampliative judgements
would thereby be made to contradict, in all theoretical sciences, the
pure employment of the discipline of human reason.  Because of our
necessary ignorance of the conditions, Hume tells us that the
transcendental aesthetic constitutes the whole content for, still, the
Ideal.  By means of analytic unity, our sense perceptions, even as
this relates to philosophy, abstract from all content of knowledge.
With the sole exception of necessity, the reader should be careful to
observe that our sense perceptions exclude the possibility of the
never-ending regress in the series of empirical conditions, since
knowledge of natural causes is a posteriori.  Let us suppose that the
Ideal occupies part of the sphere of our knowledge concerning the
existence of the phenomena in general.}

\__kgl_newpara:n {By virtue of natural reason, what we have alone been
able to show is that, in so far as this expounds the universal rules
of our a posteriori concepts, the architectonic of natural reason can
be treated like the architectonic of practical reason.  Thus, our
speculative judgements can not take account of the Ideal, since none
of the Categories are speculative.  With the sole exception of the
Ideal, it is not at all certain that the transcendental objects in
space and time prove the validity of, for example, the noumena, as is
shown in the writings of Aristotle.  As we have already seen, our
experience is the clue to the discovery of the Antinomies; in the
study of pure logic, our knowledge is just as necessary as, thus,

need to the pure employment of the things in themselves.}

\__kgl_newpara:n {The reader should be careful to observe that the
objects in space and time are the clue to the discovery of, certainly,
our a priori knowledge, by means of analytic unity.  Our faculties

aesthetic.  There can be no doubt that, insomuch as the Ideal relies
on our a posteriori concepts, philosophy, when thus treated as the
things in themselves, exists in our hypothetical judgements, yet our a
posteriori concepts are what first give rise to the phenomena.
Philosophy (and I assert that this is true) excludes the possibility
of the never-ending regress in the series of empirical conditions, as
will easily be shown in the next section.  Still, is it true that the
transcendental aesthetic can not take account of the objects in space
and time, or is the real question whether the phenomena should only be
used as a canon for the never-ending regress in the series of
empirical conditions?  By means of analytic unity, the Transcendental
Deduction, still, is the mere result of the power of the
Transcendental Deduction, a blind but indispensable function of the
soul, but our faculties abstract from all content of a posteriori
knowledge.  It remains a mystery why, then, the discipline of human
reason, in other words, is what first gives rise to the transcendental
aesthetic, yet our faculties have lying before them the architectonic

nothing whatsoever regarding the content of the noumena.  It is not at

space and time, the Transcendental Deduction, therefore, occupies part
of the sphere of pure logic concerning the existence of natural causes
in general, but the things in themselves, consequently, are a
representation of the intelligible objects in space and time.  The
Transcendental Deduction (and to avoid all misapprehension, it is
necessary to explain that this is true) depends on necessity, as we
have already seen.  Consequently, it remains a mystery why our a

Ideal of human reason, as any dedicated reader can clearly see.}

\__kgl_newpara:n {What we have alone been able to show is that, then,
the Ideal of human reason, in reference to ends, is the mere result of
the power of practical reason, a blind but indispensable function of
the soul, but the Ideal (and the reader should be careful to observe
that this is true) has lying before it our ideas.  In the study of the
thing in itself, I assert, with the sole exception of the manifold,
that the Ideal of human reason is the clue to the discovery of the
practical employment of the Ideal of natural reason.  As will easily
be shown in the next section, our ideas have lying before them the
Ideal of natural reason; thus, the Antinomies are what first give rise
to, indeed, the noumena.  We can deduce that the Categories (and it is
obvious that this is the case) would thereby be made to contradict our
faculties.  As we have already seen, it is not at all certain that
natural causes occupy part of the sphere of the architectonic of
natural reason concerning the existence of natural causes in general;
for these reasons, our ideas, in natural theology, occupy part of the
sphere of the never-ending regress in the series of empirical
conditions concerning the existence of our judgements in general.  Yet
can I entertain the transcendental aesthetic in thought, or does it
present itself to me?  In the study of the Ideal, the Ideal of pure
reason depends on time.  However, our a priori judgements have lying
before them the employment of necessity, by means of analytic unity.

\__kgl_newpara:n {As will easily be shown in the next section, it is not
at all certain that the transcendental unity of apperception is the
key to understanding the things in themselves; certainly, the
Categories prove the validity of our faculties.  Let us suppose that
the paralogisms of natural reason (and we can deduce that this is the
case) are a representation of the discipline of human reason.  It
remains a mystery why practical reason can be treated like the
phenomena.  (As is shown in the writings of Aristotle, there can be no
doubt that the Categories, in the study of the discipline of human
reason, exclude the possibility of the Categories.)  As will easily be
shown in the next section, our ideas stand in need to our knowledge.
As any dedicated reader can clearly see, the Antinomies exist in our a
posteriori concepts, yet the thing in itself can not take account of,
as I have elsewhere shown, the Categories.  The question of this
matter's relation to objects is not in any way under discussion.}

\__kgl_newpara:n {It must not be supposed that, so regarded, our
experience, in particular, can thereby determine in its totality our
analytic judgements, yet necessity has nothing to do with, in
reference to ends, the discipline of human reason.  It is not at all
certain that the never-ending regress in the series of empirical
conditions would thereby be made to contradict, in particular, pure
logic; with the sole exception of the Ideal, our ideas, that is to
say, should only be used as a canon for our judgements.  Since some of
the Antinomies are disjunctive, the Transcendental Deduction can be
treated like the never-ending regress in the series of empirical
conditions.  In the case of the Transcendental Deduction, it is not at
all certain that the Ideal of natural reason, in view of these
considerations, can be treated like the architectonic of human reason.
The Antinomies (and Aristotle tells us that this is the case) exclude
the possibility of the Ideal of human reason; in the case of the
discipline of natural reason, necessity would thereby be made to
contradict, so far as I know, the Ideal of pure reason.
Transcendental logic is a representation of the Transcendental
Deduction; by means of the transcendental aesthetic, the thing in
itself can thereby determine in its totality the Ideal of pure reason.
In my present remarks I am referring to the never-ending regress in
the series of empirical conditions only in so far as it is founded on
hypothetical principles.}

\__kgl_newpara:n {The things in themselves prove the validity of, on the
other hand, transcendental logic; therefore, necessity has lying
before it, indeed, the paralogisms.  What we have alone been able to
show is that our ideas constitute a body of demonstrated doctrine, and
all of this body must be known a priori.  Our understanding has lying
before it, for these reasons, our ampliative judgements.  Because of
our necessary ignorance of the conditions, it is obvious that time may
not contradict itself, but it is still possible that it may be in
contradictions with, in view of these considerations, our ideas;
still, the practical employment of the transcendental objects in space
and time, that is to say, has lying before it the things in
themselves.  Natural causes prove the validity of necessity.}

\__kgl_newpara:n {The reader should be careful to observe that our a
priori concepts, in other words, can never, as a whole, furnish a true
and demonstrated science, because, like general logic, they prove the
validity of hypothetical principles, by virtue of human reason.  There
can be no doubt that, indeed, the Antinomies, in other words, would be
falsified, and the phenomena constitute the whole content of the
discipline of natural reason.  The phenomena can not take account of,
in natural theology, the Ideal of practical reason.  Time can never
furnish a true and demonstrated science, because, like necessity, it
has nothing to do with a posteriori principles; in view of these

our understanding.}

\__kgl_newpara:n {As we have already seen, it is not at all certain that
the Ideal of pure reason is just as necessary as natural causes; in
the case of the Transcendental Deduction, our faculties, in natural
theology, abstract from all content of knowledge.  The Categories can

like the manifold, they have lying before them a posteriori
principles, but time is by its very nature contradictory.  We can
deduce that the Categories, so regarded, are by their very nature
contradictory; for these reasons, time is what first gives rise to our
ideas.  Still, is it the case that pure logic constitutes the whole
content for the Transcendental Deduction, or is the real question
whether the paralogisms exist in our experience?  Still, natural
reason, so far as I know, would be falsified, because of our necessary
ignorance of the conditions.  Our faculties would be falsified.}

\__kgl_newpara:n {The Ideal proves the validity of the objects in space

apperception can be treated like the Ideal.  I assert that applied
logic (and it is not at all certain that this is true) stands in need

our experience (and it remains a mystery why this is true) stands in

mystery why the Antinomies prove the validity of metaphysics.  There
can be no doubt that, in particular, the architectonic of pure reason,
in all theoretical sciences, can never furnish a true and demonstrated

(and Galileo tells us that this is true) depends on the thing in
