\section{Introduction}

\pkg{Polyglossia} is a package for facilitating multilingual typesetting with
\XeLaTeX\ and (with some exceptions) \LuaLaTeX. Basically, it
can be used as an alternative to \pkg{babel} for performing the following
tasks automatically:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Loading the appropriate hyphenation patterns.
\item Setting the script and language tags of the current font (if possible and
      available), via the package \pkg{fontspec}.
\item Switching to a font assigned by the user to a particular script or language.
\item Adjusting some typographical conventions according to the current language
      (such as afterindent, frenchindent, spaces before or after punctuation marks,
      etc.).
\item Redefining all document strings (like “chapter”, “figure”, “bibliography”).
\item Adapting the formatting of dates (for non-Gregorian calendars via external
      packages bundled with polyglossia: currently the Hebrew, Islamic and Farsi
      calendars are supported).
\item For languages that have their own numbering system, modifying the formatting
      of numbers appropriately (this also includes redefining the alphabetic sequence
      for non-Latin alphabets).\footnote{%
        This is done by bundled sub-packages such as \pkg{arabicnumbers}.}
\item Ensuring proper directionality if the document contains languages
      that are written from right to left (via the package \pkg{bidi},
      available separately).
\end{enumerate}
%
Several features of \pkg{babel} that do not make sense in the \XeTeX\ world (like font
encodings, shorthands, etc.) are not supported.
Generally speaking, \pkg{polyglossia} aims to remain as compatible as possible
with the fundamental features of \pkg{babel} while being cleaner, light-weight,
and modern. The package \pkg{antomega} has been very beneficial in our attempt to
reach this objective.

\paragraph{Requirements} The current version of \pkg{polyglossia} makes use of some convenient
macros defined in the \pkg{etoolbox} package by \TA{Philipp Lehmann} and \TA{Joseph Wright}.
Being designed for \XeLaTeX\ and \LuaLaTeX, it obviously also relies on \pkg{fontspec} by
\TA{Will Robertson}. For languages written from right to left, it needs the package \pkg{bidi}
(for \XeTeX) or \pkg{luabidi} (for \LuaTeX) by \TA{Vafa Khalighi} (\textarabic{وفا خليقي}) and
the \pkg{bidi-tex GitHub Organisation}.
Polyglossia also bundles three packages for calendaric computations (\pkg{hebrewcal},
\pkg{hijrical}, and \pkg{farsical}).


\section{Setting up multilingual documents}

\subsection{Activating languages}

The default language of a document is specified by means of the command
	\displaycmd{\setdefaultlanguage\oarg{options}\marg{lang}}{\setdefaultlanguage}
(or, equivalently, \Cmd\setmainlanguage).
Secondary languages are specified with
	\displaycmd{\setotherlanguage\oarg{options}\marg{lang}.}{\setotherlanguage}
All these commands allow you to set language-specific options.\footnote{%
	Section~\ref{specific} documents these options for the respective languages.}
It is also possible to load a series of secondary languages at once (but without options)
using
	\displaycmd{\setotherlanguages\marg{lang1⟩,⟨lang2⟩,⟨lang3⟩,⟨…}.}{\setotherlanguages}
%
All language-specific options can be modified locally by means of the
language-switching commands described in section \ref{languageswitching}.

\paragraph{Note} In general, it is advisable to activate the languages \emph{after} all
packages have been loaded. This is particularly important if you use right-to-left scripts
or languages with babel shorthands.


\subsection{Supported languages}

Table~\ref{tab:lang} lists all languages currently supported.
Those in \TR{red} have specific options and/or commands
that are explained in section \ref{specific} below.

\paragraph{Version Notes} The support for Amharic\new{1.0.1} should be considered an experimental attempt to
port the package \pkg{ethiop}; feedback is welcome.
Version 1.1.1\new{1.1.1} added support for Asturian, %\footnote{ Provided by Kevin Godby and Xuacu Saturio.},
Lithuanian, %\footnote{ Provided by Kevin Godby and Paulius Sladkevičius.},
and Urdu. %\footnote{ Provided by Kamal Abdali.}
%
Version 1.2\new{1.2.0} introduced Armenian, Occitan, Bengali,
Lao, Malayalam, Marathi, Tamil, Telugu, and Turkmen.\footnote{%
  See acknowledgements at the end for due credit to the various contributors.}
Version 1.43\new{1.43} brought basic support for Japanese (this
is considered experimental, feedback is appreciated).
In version 1.45\new{1.45}, support for Kurdish and Mongolian as well as some new
variants (Canadian French and English) have been added. Furthermore, for consistency reasons, some language have
been renamed (\emph{farsi}\textrightarrow\emph{persian}, \emph{friulan}\textrightarrow\emph{friulian},
\emph{magyar}\textrightarrow\emph{hungarian}, \emph{portuges}\textrightarrow\emph{portuguese},
\emph{samin}\textrightarrow\emph{sami}) or merged (\emph{bahasai}\slash\emph{bahasam}\textrightarrow\emph{malay},
\emph{brazil}\slash\emph{portuges}\textrightarrow\emph{portuguese},
\emph{lsorbian}\slash\emph{usorbian}\textrightarrow\emph{sorbian},
\emph{irish}\slash\emph{scottish}\textrightarrow\emph{gaelic},
\emph{norsk}\slash\emph{nynorsk}\textrightarrow\emph{norwegian}). The old names are still supported for backwards
compatibility reasons.
Version 1.46\new{1.46} introduces support for Afrikaans, Belarusian, Bosnian and Georgian.


\subsection{Relation to and use of Babel language names}\label{sec:babelnames}

If you are familiar with the \pkg{babel} package, you will note that \pkg{polyglossia}'s language naming
slightly differs. Whereas \pkg{babel} has a unique name for each language variety (\eg\emph{american} and \emph{british}),
\pkg{polyglossia} differentiates language varieties via language options (\eg \emph{english}, ¦variant=american¦).

Furthermore, \pkg{babel} sometimes uses abbreviated language names (\eg\emph{bahasam} for Bahasa Malayu) as well
as endonyms, \ie language names coming from the designated languages (such as \emph{bahasa}, \emph{canadien} or \emph{magyar}).
As opposed to this, \pkg{polyglossia} always uses spelled-out (lower-cased) English language names.
Please refer to table~\ref{tab:bbllang} for the differing language names in both packages.

\end{table}

For convenience reasons, \pkg{polyglossia} also supports the use of babel names\new{1.46} (for the few justified
exceptions, please refer to the notes in table~\ref{tab:bbllang}).
The babel names listed in table~\ref{tab:bbllang} can be used instead of the corresponding polyglossia
name\slash options in \cmd\setdefaultlanguage\ and \cmd\setotherlanguage\ as well as in the \pkg{polyglossia} and
\pkg{babel} language switching commands\slash environments documented in section~\ref{sec:langcmds} and
\ref{sec:babelcmds} (\eg \cmd\textaustrian\ is synonymous to ¦\textgerman[variant=austrian,spelling=old]¦).
However, unless you have special reasons, we strongly encourage you to use the \pkg{polyglossia} names.


\subsection{Using IETF language tags}\label{sec:langtags}

\pkg{Polyglossia}\new{1.47} also supports the use of language tags that conform to the IETF BCP-47
\emph{Best Current Practice}.\footnote{Please refer to \url{https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47} and
	\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IETF_language_tag} for details.}
Thus, you can use tags such as ¦en-GB¦ (for British English) or ¦de-AT-1901¦ (for Austrian German, old spelling)
in \cmd\setdefaultlanguage\ and \cmd\setotherlanguage\ as well as in the language switching command
\cmd{\textlang\marg{tag}}, the environment \cmd{\begin\{lang\}\marg{tag}} \ldots\ \cmd{\end\{lang\}} and the \pkg{babel}
language switching commands\slash environments documented in section~\ref{sec:babelcmds}.
Table~\ref{tab:BCP47-polyglossia} lists the currently supported tags.

\subsection{Global options}

\pkg{Polyglossia} can be loaded with the following global package options:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \xpgboolkeyfalse[1.1.1]{babelshorthands}
		Globally activates \pkg{babel} shorthands whenever available. Currently
		shorthands are implemented for Afrikaans, Belarusian, Catalan, Croatian,
		Czech, Dutch, Finnish, Georgian, German, Italian, Latin, Mongolian,
		Russian, Slovak, and Ukrainian. Please refer to the respective language descriptions
		(sec.~\ref{specific}) for details.

	\item \xpgboolkeyfalse{localmarks} redefines the internal \LaTeX\ macros \cmd\markboth\ and
		\cmd\markright\ to the effect that the header text is explicitly set in the currently
		active language (\ie wrapped into \cmd\foreignlanguage\{\meta{lang}\}\{\meta{\ldots}\}).
		
		In earlier versions of \pkg{polyglossia},\new{1.2.0} this
		option was enabled by default, but we now realize that it causes more problems
		than it helps (since it breaks if a package or class redefines \cmd\markboth\ or
		\cmd\markright), so it is now disabled by default. For backwards compatibility, the
		option \xpgoption{nolocalmarks} which used to switch off the previous default, and
		now equals the default, is still available.

	\item \xpgoption{quiet} turns off most info messages and some of the warnings issued
		by \LaTeX, \pkg{fontspec} and \pkg{polyglossia}.
\end{itemize}

\section{Language-switching commands}\label{languageswitching}

\subsection{Recommended commands}\label{sec:langcmds}
For each activated language the command
\cmd{\text\meta{lang}\oarg{options}\marg{…}} \DescribeMacro{\text\meta{lang}}
(as well as the synonymous \DescribeMacro{\textlang}%
\cmd{\textlang\oarg{options}\marg{lang}\marg{…}}\new{1.46})
becomes available for short insertions of text in that language.

For example ¦\textrussian{\today}¦ and ¦\textlang{russian}{\today}¦ yield \textrussian{\today}
The commands switch to the correct hyphenation patterns, they activate
some extra features for the selected language (such as extra spacing before
punctuation in French), and they translate the date when using \cmd\today.
They do not, however, translate so-called \textit{caption strings}, \ie
``chapter'', ``figure'' etc., to the local language (these remain in the currently active `outer'
language).

The\DescribeEnv{\meta{lang}}\ environment \meta{lang}, which is also available for any activated language
(as well as the equivalent \DescribeMacro{lang}%
\cmd{\begin\{lang\}\oarg{options}\marg{lang}} \dots{} \cmd{\end\{lang\}}\new{1.47}),
is meant for longer passages of text. It behaves slightly different than the \cmd{\text\meta{lang}} and
\cmd\textlang\ commands: It does everything the latter do, but additionally, the caption strings
are translated as well, and the language is also passed to auxiliary files, the table of contents
and the lists of figures/tables.
Like the commands, the environment provides the possibility of setting language options locally.
For instance the following allows us to quote the beginning
of Homer’s \textit{Iliad}:

\begin{Verbatim}[formatcom=\color{xpgblue}]
  \begin{quote}
   \begin{greek}[variant=ancient]
     μῆνιν ἄειδε θεὰ Πηληϊάδεω Ἀχιλῆος οὐλομένην, ἣ μυρί' Ἀχαιοῖς
     ἄλγε' ἔθηκε, πολλὰς δ' ἰφθίμους ψυχὰς Ἄϊδι προί̈αψεν ἡρώων,
     αὐτοὺς δὲ ἑλώρια τεῦχε κύνεσσιν οἰωνοῖσί τε πᾶσι, Διὸς δ'
     ἐτελείετο βουλή, ἐξ οὗ δὴ τὰ πρῶτα διαστήτην ἐρίσαντε Ἀτρεί̈δης
     τε ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν καὶ δῖος Ἀχιλλεύς.
   \end{greek}
  \end{quote}
\end{Verbatim}

\vspace{-.5\baselineskip}

\begin{quote}
\begin{greek}[variant=ancient]
μῆνιν ἄειδε θεὰ Πηληϊάδεω Ἀχιλῆος οὐλομένην, ἣ μυρί' Ἀχαιοῖς ἄλγε' ἔθηκε,
πολλὰς δ' ἰφθίμους ψυχὰς Ἄϊδι προί̈αψεν ἡρώων, αὐτοὺς δὲ ἑλώρια τεῦχε κύνεσσιν
οἰωνοῖσί τε πᾶσι, Διὸς δ' ἐτελείετο βουλή, ἐξ οὗ δὴ τὰ πρῶτα διαστήτην ἐρίσαντε
Ἀτρεί̈δης τε ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν καὶ δῖος Ἀχιλλεύς.
\end{greek}
\end{quote}

\noindent\DescribeEnv{Arabic} Note that for Arabic one cannot use the environment ¦arabic¦,
as \cmd\arabic\ is defined internally by \LaTeX. In this case
we need to use the environment ¦Arabic¦ instead.

\subsection{Babel commands}\label{sec:babelcmds}
Some macros defined in \pkg{babel}’s \file{hyphen.cfg} (and thus usually
compiled into the \XeLaTeX\ and \LuaLaTeX\ format) are redefined, but keep a
similar behaviour.
\begin{itemize}
\item \DescribeMacro{\selectlanguage}\cmd{\selectlanguage\oarg{options}\marg{lang}}
\item \DescribeMacro{\foreignlanguage}\cmd{\foreignlanguage\oarg{options}\marg{lang}\marg{…}}
\item \DescribeEnv{otherlanguage}\cmd{\begin\{otherlanguage\}\oarg{options}\marg{lang}} \dots{} \cmd{\end\{otherlanguage\}}
\item \DescribeEnv{otherlanguage*}\cmd{\begin\{otherlanguage*\}\oarg{options}\marg{lang}} \dots{} \cmd{\end\{otherlanguage*\}}
\end{itemize}
%
\cmd\selectlanguage\marg{lang} and the ¦otherlanguage¦ environment are identical to the
the \meta{lang} environment, except that \cmd\selectlanguage\marg{lang}
does not need to be explicitly closed. The command \cmd\foreinlanguage\marg{lang}\marg{…} and the ¦otherlanguage*¦
environment are identical with the use of the \cmd\text\meta{lang} or \cmd\textlang\ command, with the one
notable exception that they do not translate the date with \cmd\today.

Since the \XeLaTeX\ and \LuaLaTeX\ format incorporate \pkg{babel}’s \file{hyphen.cfg},
the low-level commands for hyphenation and language switching
defined there are also accessible.

\subsection{Other commands}
The following commands are probably of lesser interest to the end user, but
ought to be mentioned here.
\begin{itemize}
\item \DescribeMacro{\selectbackgroundlanguage}\cmd{\selectbackgroundlanguage\marg{lang}}:
    this selects the global font setup and the numbering definitions for the default language.

\item \DescribeMacro{\resetdefaultlanguage}\cmd{\resetdefaultlanguage\oarg{options}\marg{lang}} (experimental):
	completely switches the default language
	to another one in the middle of a document: \textit{this may have adverse effects}!

\item \Cmd\normalfontlatin: in an environment where \cmd\normalfont\ has been redefined
	to a non-latin script, this will reset to the font defined with \cmd\setmainfont\ etc.
	In a similar vein, it is possible to use \Cmd\rmfamilylatin, \Cmd\sffamilylatin,
	and \Cmd\ttfamilylatin.

\item \Cmd\latinalph: Representation of counter as a lower-case letter:  1 = a, 2 = b, etc.

\item \Cmd\latinAlph: Representation of counter as a upper-case letter:  1 = A, 2 = B, etc.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Setting up alias commands}

By means of the macro
\displaycmd{\setlanguagealias\oarg{options}\marg{language}\marg{alias}}{\setlanguagealias}\new{1.46}
you can define alias commands for specific language (variants). \Eg

\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
\setlanguagealias[variant=austrian]{german}{AT}
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}
%
will define a command \cmd{\textAT} as well as an environment ¦{AT}¦ which will link towards
the command ¦\textgerman[variant=austrian]¦ and the environment ¦{german}[variant=austrian]¦,
respectively. The aliases can also be used in the language switching commands described in
section~\ref{sec:langcmds} and \ref{sec:babelcmds}.
Note, though, that the usual restrictions for command names apply, so something such as
¦de-AT¦ or ¦de_AT¦ will not work since ¦-¦ and ¦_¦ are not allowed in command names (the same
holds true for any non-ASCII character and for digits).

For the latter case, and for the case where an alias would clash with an existing command
(\eg ¦\fi¦) or a \cmd{\text\meta{\ldots}} command (\eg \cmd\textit), a starred version \Cmd{\setlanguagealias*}
is provided which does neither define a \cmd{\text\meta{alias}} command nor an \meta{alias} environment,
but which will set up the alias for everything else, including \cmd{\textlang\marg{alias}}
and \cmd{\begin\{lang\}\marg{alias}}.

\pkg{Polyglossia} comes with some aliases predefined, namely aliases for \pkg{babel} language names
(see sec.~\ref{sec:babelnames}) and for IETF BCP-47 language tags (the latter via \cmd{\setlanguagealias*};
see sec.~\ref{sec:langtags}).

\section{Font setup}

With polyglossia it is possible to associate a specific font with any script or language
that occurs in the document. That font should always be defined as
\cmd{\⟨script⟩font}\ or \cmd{\⟨language⟩font}.
For instance, if the default font defined by \cmd\setmainfont\
does not support Greek, then one can define the font used to display Greek with:\\
\centerline{ \cmd\newfontfamily\cmd{\greekfont[Script=Greek,\meta{…}]\marg{font}}. }
Note that polyglossia will use the font defined as is, so assure to do all necessary settings
(please refer to the \pkg{fontspec} documentation for details).
For instance, if \cmd\arabicfont\ is explicitly defined, then the option ¦Script=Arabic¦ should
be included in that definition.

If a specific sans serif or monospace (`teletype') font is needed for a particular script or language,
it can be defined by means of \new{1.2.0}
\cmd{\⟨script⟩fontsf} or \cmd{\⟨language⟩fontsf} and \cmd{\⟨script⟩fonttt} or \cmd{\⟨language⟩fonttt}, respectively.

Whenever a new language is activated, \pkg{polyglossia} will first check whether
a font has been defined for that language or – for languages in non-Latin scripts –
for the script it uses. If it is not defined, it will use the currently active font
and – in the case of OpenType fonts – will attempt to turn on the appropriate
OpenType tags for the script and language used, in case these are available in
the font, by means of \pkg{fontspec}’s \cmd\addfontfeature. If the current font
does not appear to support the script of that language, an error message is
displayed.

\section{Adapting hyphenation}

\subsection{Hyphenation exceptions}

\TeX\ provides the command \cmd\hyphenation\marg{exceptions} to globally define hyphenation exceptions
which override the hyphenation patterns for specified words. The command takes as argument a space-separated
list of words where hyphenation points are marked by a dash (if no dash is used, the respective word is not
hyphenated at all):
\begin{Verbatim}
\hyphenation{%
  po-ly-glos-sia
  LaTeX
}
\end{Verbatim}
%
These exceptions, however, apply to all languages. In addition to this, \pkg{polyglossia} provides
the command\new{1.45}
\displaycmd{\xpghyphenation\oarg{options}\marg{lang}\marg{exceptions}}{\xpghyphenation}
which can be used to define exceptions that only apply to a specific language or language variant,
respectively.

\subsection{Hyphenation disabling}

In some very specific contexts (such as music score creation), \TeX{} hyphenation
is something to avoid as it may cause troubles. \pkg{polyglossia} provides two
functions: \Cmd\disablehyphenation\ and \Cmd\enablehyphenation. Note that if
you select a new language while hyphenation is disabled, it will remain disabled.
If you re-enable it, the hyphenation patterns of the currently selected language
will be activated.

\section{Language-specific options and commands}\label{specific}

This section gives a list of all languages for which options and end-user
commands are defined. Note the following conventions:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The preset value of each option (\ie the setting that applies by default,
	if the option is not explicitly set) is given in \xpgpresetvalue{italics}.
	\item If an option key may be used without a value, the value that applies
	for value-less keys is marked by a preceding \xpgdefaultvalue{asterisk}.
\end{itemize}
For instance, \texttt{babelshorthands = *true} or \texttt{\textit{false}} means that
\xpgvalue{babelshorthands} is \xpgvalue{false} by default in the respective language,
and that passing \xpgvalue{babelshorthands} (without value) is equivalent to passing
\xpgvalue{babelshorthands=true}.

\subsection{afrikaans}\label{afrikaans}
\paragraph*{Options:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \xpgboolkeyfalse[1.1.1]{babelshorthands}
	If this is turned on, the following shorthands defined for fine-tuning hyphenation and
	micro-typography of Afrikaans words are activated:
	\begin{shorthands}
		\item[¦"-¦] adds a hyphenation point that does still allow for hyphenation at the points preset
		in the hyphenation patterns (as opposed to \cmd\- in default \TeX).
		\item[\texttt{"\textasciitilde}] for a hyphen sign without a breakpoint. Useful for
		cases where the hyphen should stick at the following syllable.
		\item[¦"|¦] disables a ligature at this position.
		\item[¦""¦] allows for a line break at this position (without hyphenation sign).
		\item[¦"/¦] a slash that allows for a subsequent line break. As opposed to \cmd\slash,
		hyphenation at the breakpoints preset in the hyphenation patterns is still allowed.
	\end{shorthands}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{arabic}\label{arabic}
\paragraph*{Options:}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item \xpgchoicekey{calendar}{\xpgpresetvalue{gregorian} or \xpgvalue{islamic} (= \xpgvalue{hijri})}
	\item \xpgchoicekey{locale}{\xpgpresetvalue{default}\footnote{ %
			For Egypt, Sudan, Yemen and the Gulf states.},
		\xpgvalue{mashriq}\footnote{ %
			For Iraq, Syria, Jordan, Lebanon and Palestine.},
		\xpgvalue{libya}, \xpgvalue{algeria}, \xpgvalue{tunisia}, \xpgvalue{morocco}, \xpgvalue{mauritania}}
		This setting influences the spelling of the month names for the Gregorian calendar,
		as well as the form of the numerals (unless overriden by the following option).
	\item \xpgchoicekey{numerals}{\xpgpresetvalue{mashriq} or \xpgvalue{maghrib}}
		The latter is the default when \xpgvalue{locale=algeria}, \xpgvalue{tunisia}, or \xpgvalue{morocco}.
	\item \xpgboolkeyfalse[1.0.3]{abjadjimnotail}
    Set this to true if you want the \textit{abjad} form of the number three to be \textarabic{ج‍} – as in the manuscript tradition – instead of the modern usage \textarabic{ج}.
	\end{itemize}
\paragraph*{Commands:}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item \Cmd\abjad and \Cmd\abjadmaghribi (see section \ref{abjad})
  \item \Cmd\aemph to emphasize text with \cmd\overline.\new{1.2.0}
    ¦\textarabic{\aemph{اب}}¦ yields \textarabic{\aemph{اب}}.
    This command is also available for Farsi, Urdu, etc.
	\end{itemize}

\subsection{armenian}\label{armenian}
\paragraph*{Options:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \xpgchoicekey[1.45]{variant}{\xpgvalue{eastern} or \xpgpresetvalue{western}}
	\item \xpgchoicekey[1.45]{numerals}{\xpgvalue{armenian} or \xpgpresetvalue{arabic}}
\end{itemize}

\subsection[belarusian]{belarusian\new{1.46}}\label{belarusian}

\paragraph*{Options:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \xpgboolkeyfalse{babelshorthands}
	If this is turned on, the following shorthands are activated:
	\begin{shorthands}
		\item[¦"-¦] adds a hyphenation point that does still allow for hyphenation at the points preset
		in the hyphenation patterns (as opposed to \cmd\-).
		\item[\texttt{"\textasciitilde}] for a hyphen sign without a breakpoint. Useful for
		cases where the hyphen should stick at the following syllable.
		\item[¦"|¦] disables a ligature at this position.
		\item[¦""¦] allows for a line break at this position (without hyphenation sign).
		\item[¦"---¦] Cyrillic emdash in plain text.
		\item[¦"--~¦] Cyrillic emdash in compound names (surnames).
		\item[¦"--*¦] Cyrillic emdash for denoting direct speech.
		\item[¦",¦] thinspace for initials with a breakpoint in following surname.
		\item[¦"‘¦] for German left double quotes (looks like ,,).
		\item[¦"’¦] for German right double quotes (looks like “).
		\item[¦"<¦] for French left double quotes (looks like <<).
		\item[¦">¦] for French right double quotes (looks like >>).
	\end{shorthands}
    \item \xpgchoicekey{numerals}{\xpgpresetvalue{arabic}, \xpgvalue{cyrillic-alph} or \xpgvalue{cyrillic-trad}}
         Uses either Arabic numerals or Cyrillic alphanumerical numbering. The two Cyrillic variants differ as follows:
         \begin{itemize}
	          \item \xpgvalue{cyrillic-alph} steps through the Cyrillic alphabet. Thus it can only be used up to 30.
	          \item \xpgvalue{cyrillic-trad} (= \xpgvalue{cyrillic}) uses a traditional Cyrillic alphanumeric system.%
	                \footnote{See \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrillic_numerals}.}
	                It supports numbers up to 999\,999.
         \end{itemize}
	\item \xpgchoicekey{spelling}{\xpgpresetvalue{modern} or \xpgvalue{classic} (= \xpgvalue{tarask})}
	With ¦spelling=classic¦, captions and dates adhere to the Taraškievica (or
	Belarusian classical) orthography rather than the standard orthography.
\end{itemize}
%
\paragraph*{Commands:}
\begin{itemize}
     \item \Cmd\Asbuk: produces uppercased Cyrillic alphanumerals, for environments such as ¦enumerate¦.
          It steps through the Cyrillic alphabet and thus it can only be used up to 30.
          The command takes a counter as argument, \eg ¦\textbelarusian{\Asbuk{page}}¦ produces \textrussian{\Asbuk{page}}.
     \item \Cmd\asbuk: same as \cmd\Asbuk\ but in lowercase.
     \item \Cmd\AsbukTrad: same as \cmd\Asbuk\ but using the traditional Cyrillic alphanumeric numbering which supports
          numbers up to 999\,999.\\
          \Eg ¦\textbelarusian{\AsbukTrad{page}}¦ produces \textrussian{\AsbukTrad{page}}.
     \item \Cmd\asbukTrad: same as \cmd\AsbukTrad\ but in lowercase.
\end{itemize}

\subsection[bengali]{bengali\new{1.2.0}}\label{bengali}
\paragraph*{Options:}
	\begin{itemize}
	  \item \xpgchoicekey{numerals}{\xpgvalue{Western}, \xpgvalue{Bengali}, or \xpgpresetvalue{Devanagari}}
		\item \xpgboolkeyfalse{changecounternumbering}
		Use specified numerals for headings and page numbers.
	\end{itemize}

\subsection{catalan}\label{catalan}
\paragraph*{Options:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \xpgboolkeyfalse[1.1.1]{babelshorthands}
    Activates the shorthands \texttt{"l} and \texttt{"L} to type geminated l or L.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph*{Commands:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \Cmd{\l.l} and \Cmd{\L.L}\new{1.1.1} can be used to type a geminated l, as in \textit{co\l.laborar},
        similar to \pkg{babel} (the glyph U+00B7 MIDDLE DOT is used as a geminating sign).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{croatian}\label{croatian}
\paragraph*{Options:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \xpgboolkeyfalse[1.47]{babelshorthands}
	If this is turned on, the following shorthands for fine-tuning hyphenation and micro-typography
	of Croatian words are activated.
	\begin{shorthands}
		\item[¦"|¦] disables a ligature at this position.
		\item[¦"=¦] for an explicit hyphen with a breakpoint, allowing for hyphenation at the
		            other points preset in the hyphenation patterns (as opposed to plain ¦-¦).
		\item[\texttt{"\textasciitilde}] for a hyphen sign without a breakpoint. Useful for
		            cases where the hyphen should stick at the following syllable.
		\item[¦"-¦] adds a hyphenation point that does still allow for hyphenation at the points preset
		            in the hyphenation patterns (as opposed to \cmd\-).
		\item[¦""¦] allows for a line break at this position (without hyphenation sign).
		\item[¦"/¦] a slash that allows for a subsequent line break. As opposed to \cmd\slash, hyphenation
		            at the breakpoints preset in the hyphenation patterns is still allowed.
	\end{shorthands}
	Furthermore, the following shorthands generate easy access to Croatian digraphs (ligatures):
	\begin{shorthands}
		\item[¦"dz¦] Generates the ligature \charifavailable{01C6}{dž}\ if the font provides it. If not, the
		             two characters are output separately. Also available for ¦"Dz¦ (\charifavailable{01C5}{Dž})
		             and ¦"DZ¦ (\charifavailable{01C4}{DŽ}).
		\item[¦"lj¦] Generates the ligature \charifavailable{01C9}{lj}\ if the font provides it. If not, the
		             two characters are output separately. Also available for ¦"Lj¦ (\charifavailable{01C8}{Lj})
		             and ¦"LJ¦ (\charifavailable{01C7}{LJ}).
		\item[¦"nj¦] Generates the ligature \charifavailable{01CC}{nj}\ if the font provides it. If not, the
		             two characters are output separately. Also available for ¦"Nj¦ (\charifavailable{01CB}{Nj})
		             and ¦"NJ¦ (\charifavailable{01CA}{NJ}).
	\end{shorthands}
	
	Finally, there are also four shorthands for quotation marks:
	\begin{shorthands}
		\item[¦"`¦] for Croatian left double quotes („).
		\item[¦"'¦] for Croatian right double quotes (”).
		\item[¦">¦] for Croatian left guillemets (»).
		\item[¦"<¦] for Croatian right guillemets («).
	\end{shorthands}
	\item \xpgboolkeyfalse[1.47]{disableligatures}
		If this is \xpgvalue{true}, all Croatian ligatures (for digraphs such as
		\charifavailable{01C6}{dž}) will be replaced by single characters. This can
		be useful if the ligatures on your font are broken (if the font does not
		have them, they are automatically replaced).

\subsection{czech}\label{czech}

\paragraph*{Options:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \xpgboolkeyfalse[1.45]{babelshorthands}
	If this is turned on, the following shorthands for Czech are activated:
	\begin{shorthands}
		\item[¦"=¦] for an explicit hyphen sign which is repeated at the beginning
		            of the next line when hyphenated, as common in Czech typesetting
		            (only needed with ¦splithyphens=false¦).
		\item[¦"‘¦] for Czech left double quotes („).
		\item[¦"’¦] for Czech right double quotes (“).
		\item[¦">¦] for Czech left double guillemets (»).
		\item[¦"<¦] for Czech right double guillemets («).
	\end{shorthands}
	\item \xpgboolkeytrue[1.45]{splithyphens}
	      According to Czech typesetting conventions, if a word with a hard hyphen (such as \emph{je-li})
	      is hyphenated at this hyphen, a second hyphenation character is to be inserted at the beginning
	      of the line that follows the hyphenation (\emph{je-/-li}).
          By default, this is done automatically\new{1.46} (if you are using \LuaTeX, the \pkg{luavlna} package is
          loaded to achieve this).
          Set this option to ¦false¦ to disable the feature.
	\item \xpgboolkeytrue[1.45]{vlna}
         According to Czech typesetting conventions, single-letter words (non-syllable prepositions)
         must not occur at line ends.
         \pkg{Polyglossia} takes care of this automatically by default\new{1.46} (if you are using \LuaTeX, the
         \pkg{luavlna} package is loaded to achieve this).
         Set this option to ¦false¦ to disable the feature.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{dutch}\label{dutch}
\paragraph*{Options:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \xpgboolkeyfalse[1.1.1]{babelshorthands}
		If this is turned on, the following shorthands defined for fine-tuning hyphenation and
		micro-typography of Dutch words are activated:
		\begin{shorthands}
		\item[¦"-¦] adds a hyphenation point that does still allow for hyphenation at the points preset
			        in the hyphenation patterns (as opposed to \cmd\- in default \TeX).
		\item[\texttt{"\textasciitilde}] for a hyphen sign without a breakpoint. Useful for
			        cases where the hyphen should stick at the following syllable.
		\item[¦"|¦] disables a ligature at this position.
		\item[¦""¦] allows for a line break at this position (without hyphenation sign).
		\item[¦"/¦] a slash that allows for a subsequent line break. As opposed to \cmd\slash,
		            hyphenation at the breakpoints preset in the hyphenation patterns is still allowed.
		\end{shorthands}
        In addition, the macro \Cmd\- is redefined to allow hyphens in the rest of the word (equivalent to ¦"-¦).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{english}\label{english}
\paragraph*{Options:}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item \xpgchoicekey{variant}{\xpgpresetvalue{american} (= \xpgvalue{us}), \xpgvalue{usmax} (same as \xpgvalue{american} but with additional hyphenation patterns),

	\item \xpgboolkeyfalse{ordinalmonthday}
		The default value is true for \xpgvalue{variant=british}.
	\end{itemize}

\subsection{esperanto}\label{esperanto}
\paragraph*{Commands:}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item \Cmd\hodiau\ and \Cmd\hodiaun are special forms of \cmd\today. The former produces the date in Esperanto
	      preceded by the article (\emph{la}), which is the most common date format.
	      The latter produces the same date format in accusative case.
	\end{itemize}

\subsection{finnish}\label{finnish}
\paragraph*{Options:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \xpgboolkeyfalse[1.45]{babelshorthands}
		If this is turned on, the following shorthands for fine-tuning hyphenation
		and micro-typography of Finnish words are activated:
		\begin{shorthands}
		\item[¦"-¦] adds a hyphenation point that does still allow for hyphenation at the points preset
                    in the hyphenation patterns (as opposed to \cmd\-).
        \item[\texttt{"\textasciitilde}] for a hyphen sign without a breakpoint. Useful for

\subsection{french}\label{french}
\paragraph*{Options:}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \xpgchoicekey{variant}{\xpgpresetvalue{french} or \xpgvalue{canadian} (=~\xpgvalue{acadian})\new{1.45}, \xpgvalue{swiss}\new{1.47}}
			Currently, the only difference between the four variants is that \xpgvalue{swiss}
			uses \xpgvalue{thincolonspace=true} by default since this conforms to the Swiss
			conventions.
		\item \xpgboolkeytrue{autospacing}
			One of the most distinct features of French typography is the addition of
			extra spacing around punctuation and quotation marks (guillemets). By
			default, polyglossia adds these spaces automatically, so you don't need
			to enter them. This options allows you to switch this feature off
			globally.
		\item \xpgboolkeyfalse[1.46]{thincolonspace}
			With \xpgvalue{variant=swiss}, the default value is \xpgvalue{true}. If \xpgvalue{false}, a full
			(non-breaking) interword space is inserted before a colon. If \xpgvalue{true}, a
			thinner space -- as before \texttt{;}, \texttt{!}, and \texttt{?} -- is
			used. Note that this option must be set after the ¦variant¦ option.
		\item \xpgboolkeytrue{autospaceguillemets}[Up to version 1.44, the option was
		called \xpgvalue{automaticspacesaroundguillemets}. For backwards compatibility
		reasons, the more verbose old option is still supported.]
			If you only want to disable the automatic addition of spacing after
			opening and before closing guillemets (and not at punctuation), set this
			to \textit{false}. Note that the more general option \textit{autospacing}
			overrides this.
		\item \xpgboolkeyfalse[1.45]{autospacetypewriter}[Babel's syntax \xpgvalue{OriginalTypewriter}
		is also supported.]
			By default, automatic spacing is disabled in typewriter font. If this is
			enabled, spacing in typewriter context is the same as with roman and sans
			serif font, depending on the \xpgvalue{autospacing} and
			\xpgvalue{autospaceguillemets} settings (note that this was the default up
			to v.~1.44).	
		\item \xpgboolkeyfalse{frenchfootnote}
			If \xpgvalue{true}, footnotes start with a non-superscripted number
			followed by a dot, as common in French typography. Note that this might
			interfere with the specific footnote handling of classes or packages.
			Also note that this option is only functional (by design) if French is
			the main language.
		\item \xpgboolkeyfalse[1.46]{frenchitemlabels}
			If \textit{true}, itemize item labels use em-dashes throughout, as common
			in French typography.  Note that this option is only functional (by
			design) if French is the main language. Also, it might interfere with
			list packages such as \pkg{enumitem}.
		\item \xpgcodekey[1.46]{itemlabels}¦\textemdash¦
			If \emph{frenchitemlabels} is true, you can customize here the used item
			label of all levels.
		\item \xpgcodekey[1.46]{itemlabeli}¦\textemdash¦
			If \emph{frenchitemlabels} is true, you can customize here the used item
			label of the first level.
		\item \xpgcodekey[1.46]{itemlabelii}¦\textemdash¦
			If \emph{frenchitemlabels} is true, you can customize here the used item
			label of the second level.
		\item \xpgcodekey[1.46]{itemlabeliii}¦\textemdash¦
			If \emph{frenchitemlabels} is true, you can customize here the used item
			label of the third level.
		\item \xpgcodekey[1.46]{itemlabeliv}¦\textemdash¦
			If \emph{frenchitemlabels} is true, you can customize here the used item
			label of the fourth level.
	\end{itemize}
\paragraph*{Commands:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \Cmd\NoAutoSpacing\new{1.45} disables automatic spacing around punctuation and quotation marks in all following text. The command can also be used locally if braces are used for grouping: ¦{\NoAutoSpacing foo:bar}¦
	\item \Cmd\AutoSpacing\new{1.45} enables automatic spacing around punctuation and quotation marks in all following text. The command can also be used locally if braces are used for grouping: ¦{\AutoSpacing regarde!}¦

\subsection[georgian]{georgian\new{1.46}}\label{georgian}

\paragraph*{Options:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \xpgboolkeyfalse{babelshorthands}
		If this is turned on, the following shorthands are activated:
		\begin{shorthands}
			\item[¦"-¦] adds a hyphenation point that does still allow for
			hyphenation at the points preset in the hyphenation patterns (as opposed
			to \cmd\-).
			\item[\texttt{"\textasciitilde}] for a hyphen sign without a breakpoint. Useful for
			cases where the hyphen should stick at the following syllable.
			\item[¦"|¦] disables a ligature at this position.
			\item[¦""¦] allows for a line break at this position (without hyphenation sign).
			\item[¦"---¦] Cyrillic emdash in plain text.
			\item[¦"--~¦] Cyrillic emdash in compound names (surnames).
			\item[¦"--*¦] Cyrillic emdash for denoting direct speech.
			\item[¦",¦] thinspace for initials with a breakpoint in following surname.
			\item[¦"‘¦] for German left double quotes (looks like ,,).
			\item[¦"’¦] for German right double quotes (looks like “).
			\item[¦"<¦] for French left double quotes (looks like <<).

\subsection{german}\label{german}
\paragraph*{Options:}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item \xpgchoicekey{variant}{\xpgpresetvalue{german}, austrian, or swiss\new{1.33.4}}
		Setting \xpgvalue{variant=austrian} or \xpgvalue{variant=swiss} uses some lexical variants.
		With \xpgvalue{spelling=old}, \xpgvalue{variant=swiss} furthermore loads specific hyphenation
		patterns.
	\item \xpgchoicekey{spelling}{\xpgpresetvalue{new} (= \xpgvalue{1996}) or \xpgvalue{old} (= \xpgvalue{1901})}
		Indicates whether hyphenation patterns for traditional (1901) or reformed
		(1996) orthography should be used. The latter is the default.
	\item \xpgboolkeyfalse[1.0.3]{babelshorthands}
		If this is turned on, all shorthands defined in \pkg{babel}
		for fine-tuning hyphenation and micro-typography of German words are activated.
		\begin{shorthands}
		\item[¦"ck¦] for ¦ck¦ to be hyphenated as ¦k-k¦ (1901 spelling).
		\item[¦"ff¦] for ¦ff¦ to be hyphenated as ¦ff-f¦ (1901 spelling); this is also available
		           for the letters l, m, n, p, r and t.
		\item[¦"|¦] disables a ligature at this position (\eg ¦Auf"|lage¦).
		\item[¦"=¦] for an explicit hyphen with a breakpoint, allowing for hyphenation at the
		           other points preset in the hyphenation patterns (as opposed to plain ¦-¦).
		\item[\texttt{"\textasciitilde}] for a hyphen sign without a breakpoint. Useful for
		           cases where the hyphen should stick at the following syllable, \eg ¦bergauf und "~ab¦.
		\item[¦"-¦] adds a hyphenation point that does still allow for hyphenation at the points preset
		           in the hyphenation patterns (as opposed to \cmd\-).
		\item[¦""¦] allows for a line break at this position (without hyphenation sign);
		           \eg ¦(pseudo"~)""wissenschaftlich¦.
		\item[¦"/¦] a slash that allows for a subsequent line break. As opposed to \cmd\slash, hyphenation at the breakpoints
		           preset in the hyphenation patterns is still allowed.
		\end{shorthands}

		There are also four shorthands for quotation signs:
		\begin{shorthands}
		\item[¦"`¦] for German left double quotes („)
		\item[¦"'¦] for German right double quotes (“)
		\item[¦"<¦] for French left double quotes («)
		\item[¦">¦] for French right double quotes (»).
		\end{shorthands}
	\item \xpgchoicekey[1.2.0]{script}{\xpgpresetvalue{latin} or \xpgvalue{blackletter}\new{1.46} (= \xpgvalue{fraktur})}
		Setting ¦script=blackletter¦ adapts the captions for typesetting German in blackletter type (using the long s (ſ)
		where appropriate).
	\end{itemize}

\subsection{greek}\label{greek}
\paragraph*{Options:}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item \xpgchoicekey{variant}{\xpgpresetvalue{monotonic} (= \xpgvalue{mono}), \xpgvalue{polytonic} (= \xpgvalue{poly}), or \xpgvalue{ancient}}

	\begin{itemize}
	\item \xpgchoicekey{numerals}{\xpgvalue{hebrew} or \xpgpresetvalue{arabic}}
	\item \xpgchoicekey{calendar}{\xpgvalue{hebrew} or \xpgpresetvalue{gregorian}}
	\item \xpgboolkeyfalse{marcheshvan}
		If \xpgvalue{true}, the second month of the civil year will be output as
		\texthebrew{מרחשון} (Marcheshvan) rather than \texthebrew{חשון} (Heshvan),
		which is the default.
	\end{itemize}
\paragraph*{Commands:}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item \Cmd\hebrewnumeral\ (= \Cmd\hebrewalph) (see section \ref{abjad}).
  \item \Cmd\aemph (see section \ref{arabic}).
	\end{itemize}

	\end{itemize}

\subsection{hungarian}\label{hungarian}
\paragraph*{Options:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \xpgchoicekey[1.46]{swapstrings}{\xpgdefaultvalue{\xpgpresetvalue{all}},
	\xpgvalue{captions}, \xpgvalue{headings}, \xpgvalue{headers}, \xpgvalue{hheaders}, or \xpgvalue{none}}
	       In Hungarian, some caption strings need to be in a different order than in other languages
	       (\eg \emph{1. fejezet} instead of \emph{Chapter 1}). By default, \pkg{polyglossia} tries hard to
	       provide the correct order for different classes and packages (standard classes, \pkg{KOMA-script},
	       \pkg{memoir}, and \pkg{titlesec} package should work, as well as \pkg{fancyhdr} and \pkg{caption}).
	       However, since the definition of these strings is not standardized, the redefinitions might not work
	       and even interfere badly if you use specific classes or packages that redefine the respective strings
	       themselves. In this case, you can disable some or all changes.
	       The possibilities are:
	       \begin{itemize}
	       	\item ¦all¦: Redefine figure and table captions, part and chapter headings, and running headers (=~default setting)
	       	\item ¦captions¦: Redefine figure and table captions only
	       	\item ¦headings¦: Redefine part and chapter headings only
	       	\item ¦headers¦: Redefine running headers only
	       	\item ¦hheaders¦: Redefine part and chapter headings as well as running headers
	       	\item ¦none¦: Do not redefine anything
	       \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\paragraph*{Commands:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \Cmd\ontoday\ (= \Cmd\ondatehungarian): special form of \cmd\today\ which produces a slightly different
	date format as used in prepositional phrases (such as ‘on February 10th’) in Hungarian.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{italian}\label{italian}
\paragraph*{Options:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \xpgboolkeyfalse[1.2.0cc]{babelshorthands}% TODO: check version
  Activates the ¦"¦ character as a switch to perform etymological
  hyphenation when followed by a letter. Furthermore, the following shorthands are activated:
  \begin{shorthands}
  	\item[¦""¦] double raised open quotes (the Italian keyboard misses the backtick).
  	\item[¦"<¦] open guillemet (looks like <<).
  	\item[¦">¦] closing guillemet (looks like >>).
  	\item[¦"/¦] a slash that allows for a subsequent line break. As opposed to \cmd\slash,
               hyphenation at the breakpoints preset in the hyphenation patterns is still allowed.
  	\item[¦"-¦] adds a hyphenation point that does still allow for hyphenation at the points preset
               in the hyphenation patterns (as opposed to \cmd\-).
  \end{shorthands}
\end{itemize}

\subsection[korean]{korean\new{1.40.0}}\label{korean}
\paragraph*{Options:}
  \begin{itemize}
	\item \xpgchoicekey{variant}{\xpgpresetvalue{plain}, \xpgvalue{classic}, or \xpgvalue{modern}}
    These variants control spacing before/after CJK punctuations.
      \begin{itemize}
        \item ¦plain¦: Do nothing
        \item ¦classic¦: Suitable for text with no interword spaces.
          This option forces CJK punctuations to half-width, and
          inserts half-width glue around them.
        \item ¦modern¦: Suitable for text with interword spaces.
          This option forces CJK punctuations to half-width, and
          inserts small (half of interword space) glue around them.
      \end{itemize}
	\item \xpgchoicekey{captions}{\xpgpresetvalue{hangul} or \xpgvalue{hanja}}
	\item \xpgchoicekey[1.47]{swapstrings}{\xpgdefaultvalue{\xpgpresetvalue{all}},
	\xpgvalue{headers}, \xpgvalue{headings}, or \xpgvalue{none}}
    With this option, Korean-style part and chapter headings, and
    running headers are available.
    It is similar to Hungarian (see \ref{hungarian}) except that
    figure and table captions are not touched.
      \begin{itemize}
        \item ¦all¦: Redefine part and chapter headings, and running headers
          (=~default setting)
        \item ¦headings¦: Redefine part and chapter headings only
        \item ¦headers¦: Redefine running headers only

		Defaults are \xpgvalue{Arabic} for Sorani and \xpgvalue{Latin} for Kurmanji.
	\item \xpgchoicekey{numerals}{\xpgvalue{western} or \xpgvalue{eastern}}
		Defaults are \xpgvalue{western} for Latin and \xpgvalue{eastern} for Arabic script, depending
		on the selection above.
	\item \xpgboolkeyfalse{abjadjimnotail}
		Set this to true if you want the \textit{abjad} form of the number three to

\begin{itemize}
	\item \xpgchoicekey{variant}{\xpgvalue{classic}, \xpgvalue{medieval}, \xpgpresetvalue{modern}, or \xpgvalue{ecclesiastic}\new{1.46}}
			These variants refer to different spelling conventions. The \xpgvalue{classic}
			and the \xpgvalue{medieval} variant do not use the letters \emph{U} and
			\emph{v}, but only \emph{V} and \emph{u}. This concerns predefined terms like
			month names as well as the behaviour of the \cmd\MakeUppercase\ and the
			\cmd\MakeLowercase\ command. The ¦medieval¦ and the
			¦ecclesiastic¦ variant use the ligatures \emph{\ae} and \emph{\oe}.
			See table \ref{tab:latin-spelling} for examples.

			Furthermore, the \xpgvalue{ecclesiastic} variant takes care for a punctuation
			spacing similar to French, but with smaller spaces, as provided for

	\item \xpgchoicekey[1.46]{hyphenation}{\xpgvalue{classic}, \xpgvalue{modern}, or \xpgvalue{liturgical}}
			There are three different sets of hyphenation patterns for Latin. Separate

			Each of the four variants mentioned above has its default set of hyphenation
			patterns as indicated by table \ref{tab:latin-hyphenation}. Use the
			¦hyphenation¦ option if the default style does not fit your needs.
			Note that the liturgical hyphenation patterns are the default of none of the
			language variants. To use them, you have to say
			\xpgvalue{hyphenation=liturgical} in any case.

	\item \xpgboolkeyfalse[1.46]{ecclesiasticfootnotes}
			Use footnotes as provided by the \pkg{ecclesiastic} package, which typesets
			footnotes with ordinary instead of superior numbers and without indentation.
			As many ecclesiastic documents and liturgical books use footnotes that are
			very similar to the ordinary \LaTeX\ ones, we do not use this footnote style
			as default even for the ¦ecclesiastic¦ variant.
		
			Note that this option is only possible if Latin is the main language of your
			document.
	\item \xpgboolkeyfalse[1.46]{usej}
			Use \emph{J/j} in predefined terms. The letter \emph{j} is not of ancient
			origin. In early modern times, it was used to distinguish the consonantic
			\emph{i} from the vocalic~\emph{i}. Nowadays, the use of \emph{j} has
			disappeared from most Latin publications. So ¦false¦ is the default
			value for all four language variants. Use this option if you prefer
			\emph{Januarii} and \emph{Maji} to \emph{Ianuarii} and \emph{Maii}.
	\item \xpgboolkey[1.46]{capitalizemonth}
			Capitalize the month name when printing dates (using the \cmd\today\
			command).  Traditionally, month names are capitalized. However, in recent
			liturgical books they are lowercase. So ¦true¦ is the default value for
			the variants ¦classic¦, ¦medieval¦, and ¦modern¦,
			whereas ¦false¦ is the default value for the ¦ecclesiastic¦
			variant.
	\item \xpgboolkeyfalse{babelshorthands}
			Enable the following shorthands inherited from \pkg{babel-latin} and the
			\pkg{ecclesiastic} package.
			\begin{shorthands}
				\item[¦"<¦] for « (left guillemet)
				\item[¦">¦] for » (right guillemet)
				\item[¦"¦] If no other shorthand applies, ¦"¦ before any letter
					character defines an optional break point allowing further break points
					within the same word (as opposed to the \cmd\- command).
				\item[¦"|¦] the same as ¦"¦, but also possible before non-letter
					characters
				\item[¦'a¦] for á (a with acute), also available for é, í, ó, ú, ý, ǽ, and
					\'œ
				\item[¦'A¦] for Á (A with acute), also available for É, Í, Ó, Ú, \'V, Ý, Ǽ,
					and \'Œ
			\end{shorthands}
			The following shorthands are only available for the ¦medieval¦ and the
			¦ecclesiastic¦ variant.

	\item \xpgboolkeyfalse[1.46]{prosodicshorthands}
			Enable shorthands for prosodic marks (macrons and breves) very similiar to
			those provided by \pkg{babel-latin} using the ¦withprosodicmarks¦
			modifier.
			Note that the active ¦=¦ character used for macrons will cause problems with
			commands using \texttt{key=value} interfaces, such as the command
			¦\includegraphics[scale=2]{...}¦. Use \cmd{\shorthandoff\{=\}} before
			such commands (and \cmd{\shorthandon\{=\}} thereafter) within every
			environment with prosodic shorthands enabled.
		
			The following shorthands are available.
			\begin{shorthands}
				\item[¦=a¦] for ā (a with macron), also available for ē, ī, ō, ū, and ȳ
				\item[¦=A¦] for Ā (A with macron), also available for Ē, Ī, Ō, Ū, V̄, and Ȳ.
					Note that a macron above the letter V is only displayed if your font
					supports the Unicode character ¦0304¦ (\emph{combining macron}).
				\item[¦=ae¦] for a͞e (ae diphthong with macron), also available for a͞u, e͞u,
					and o͞e. Note that macrons above diphthongs are only displayed if your font
					supports the Unicode character ¦035E¦ (\emph{combining double
					macron}).
				\item[¦=Ae¦] for A͞e (Ae diphthong with macron), also available for A͞u, E͞u,
					and O͞e.
				\item[¦=AE¦] for A͞E (AE diphthong with macron), also available for A͞U, E͞U,
					and O͞E.
				\item[¦\textasciicircum a¦] for ă (a with breve), also available for ĕ, ĭ,
					ŏ, ŭ, and y̆.  Note that a breve above the letter y is only displayed if
					your font supports the Unicode character ¦0306¦ (\emph{combining
					breve}).
				\item[¦\textasciicircum A¦] Ă (A with breve), also available for Ĕ, Ĭ, Ŏ,
					Ŭ, V̆, and Y̆. Note that breves above the letters V and Y are only displayed

		If this is turned on, the following shorthands for Slovak are activated:
		\begin{shorthands}
        \item[¦"=¦] for an explicit hyphen sign which is repeated at the beginning
                    of the next line when hyphenated, as common in Slovak typesetting
		            (only needed with ¦splithyphens=false¦).
        \item[¦"|¦] disables a ligature at this position.
        \item[\texttt{"\textasciitilde}] for a hyphen sign without a breakpoint. Useful for
                    cases where the hyphen should stick at the following syllable.
        \item[¦"-¦] adds a hyphenation point that does still allow for hyphenation at the points preset
                    in the hyphenation patterns (as opposed to \cmd\-).
        \item[¦""¦] allows for a line break at this position (without hyphenation sign).
        \item[¦"/¦] a slash that allows for a subsequent line break. As opposed to \cmd\slash, hyphenation at the breakpoints
                    preset in the hyphenation patterns is still allowed.
        \item[¦"‘¦] for Slovak left double quotes (looks like ,,).
        \item[¦"’¦] for Slovak right double quotes (looks like “).
        \item[¦">¦] for Slovak left double guillemets (looks like >>).
        \item[¦"<¦] for Slovak right double guillemets (looks like <<).
		\end{shorthands}
	\item \xpgboolkeytrue[1.46]{splithyphens}
	      According to Slovak typesetting conventions, if a word with a hard hyphen (such as \emph{je-li})
	      is hyphenated at this hyphen, a second hyphenation character is to be inserted at the beginning
          of the line that follows the hyphenation (\emph{je-/-li}).
	      By default, this is done automatically (if you are using \LuaTeX, the \pkg{luavlna} package is
	      loaded to achieve this).
	      Set this option to ¦false¦ to disable the feature.
	\item \xpgboolkeytrue[1.46]{vlna}
	      According to Slovak typesetting conventions, single-letter words (non-syllable prepositions)
	      must not occur at line ends.
	      \pkg{Polyglossia} takes care of this automatically by default (if you are using \LuaTeX, the

	      	      \emph{lím\,sup}, \emph{lím\,inf}, \emph{máx}, \emph{mín}, \emph{ínf}, \emph{mód}).
	      	\item ¦spaced¦ causes some math operators to use spaces where usual in Spanish (\emph{arc\,cos},
	      	      \emph{arc\,sen}, \emph{arc\,tg}).
	      	\item ¦all¦ activates ¦accented¦ and ¦spaced¦ and furthermore provides Spanish localizations of

              \meta{lang} is activated via \cmd\selectlanguage command or the \meta{lang} environment
	\item \Cmd{\inlineextras\meta{lang}} stores macros that are to be executed when the language
	          \meta{lang} is activated locally via \cmd\text\meta{lang} command
	\item \Cmd{\noextras\meta{lang}} stores macros that are to be executed when the language
	          \meta{lang} is closed
\end{itemize}
%
In order to redefine internal macros, we recommend to use the command \cmd\gappto.
For compatibility with \pkg{babel} the command \cmd\addto\ is also available
to the same effect. For instance, to change the \cmd\chaptername\ for language ¦lingua¦,
you can do this:
\begin{verbatim}
\gappto\captionslingua{\def\chaptername{Caput}}
\end{verbatim}
%
Note that this needs to be done after the respective language has been loaded with
\cmd\setmainlanguage\ or \cmd\setotherlanguage.

Specifically for package authors, analogous commands are provided which are only executed
if a specific language \emph{variety} is used. As opposed to the macros above, these refer
to babel names. Other than that, the function is identical:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \Cmd{\captions@bbl@\meta{babelname}}
	\item \Cmd{\date@bbl@\meta{babelname}}
	\item \Cmd{\blockextras@bbl@\meta{babelname}}
	\item \Cmd{\inlineextras@bbl@\meta{babelname}}
	\item \Cmd{\noextras@bbl@\meta{babelname}}
\end{itemize}
%
By default, these macros are undefined. If they are defined (\eg by an external package),
they will be executed after their respective \meta{lang} counterpart and thus can be used to
overwrite definitions of the former. Again, use \cmd\gappto\ to define\slash modify these macros.
For instance, to add a new caption \cmd\footnotename\ to the Swiss variety of German (babel name
¦nswissgerman¦), you can do this:
\begin{verbatim}
\gappto\captions@bbl@nswissgerman{\def\footnotename{Fussnote}}
\end{verbatim}
%
If you do this in a document preamble rather than in a package, you need to embrace the redefinition
by \cmd\makeatletter\ and \cmd\makeatother\ due to the ¦@¦ in the macro names.

Finally, as soon as the language has been switched (either inline or as a block), \pkg{polyglossia}
executes the (by default empty) hook
\begin{itemize}
	\item \Cmd{\polyglossia@language@switched}
\end{itemize}
to which you can append arbitrary code (via \cmd\gappto) that should be executed if (a particular)
language is being activated. This is done before any of the above
macros are issued (so you can still alter them), but at a point where \cmd\languagename, \cmd\babelname\
and \cmd\languageid\ are already set, so you can condition on specific languages in your code.
This hook is particularly provided for package authors.

\section{Script-specific numbering}

Languages and scripts have specific numbering conventions. Some use decimal digits
(\eg Arabic numerals), some use alphabetic or alphanumerical notation (\eg Roman numbering).
In some cases, different conventions are available (\eg Mashriq or Maghrib numbering
in Arabic script, Arabic or Hebrew [=~alphanumeric] numbering in Hebrew).

If the latter is the case, \pkg{polyglossia} provides language options which allow you to select
or switch to the suitable convention. With the appropriate language option set, \pkg{polyglossia}
will automatically convert the output of internal \LaTeX\ counters to their
localized forms, for instance to display page, chapter and section numbers.

For manual input of numbers, macros are provided. These convert Arabic numeric input to the respective
local decimal digit (see sec.~\ref{sec:decdigit}), alphanumeric representation (see sec.~\ref{abjad})
or whatever is appropriate (see sec.~\ref{sec:localnumber}). The possibilities are described in turn.

\subsection{General localization of numbering}\label{sec:localnumber}

As of 1.45,\new{1.45} \pkg{polyglossia} provides a generic macro \Cmd\localnumeral\ which converts numbers
to the current local form (which might be script-specific decimal digit, an alphabetic numbering or something else).
For instance in an Arabic environment
¦\localnumeral{42}¦ yields \textarabic{\localnumeral{42}}, whereas in an Hebrew environment, it
results in \texthebrew[numerals=hebrew]{\localnumeral{42}} with ¦numerals=hebrew¦, and \texthebrew{\localnumeral{42}}
with ¦numerals=arabic¦. Note that, as opposed to the various ¦digits¦ macros (described in sec.~\ref{sec:decdigit}),
the argument of \cmd\localnumeral\ must consist of numbers only.

For\new{1.45} the conversion of counters, the starred version \Cmd{\localnumeral*} is provided. This takes a counter as argument.
For instance in an Arabic environment ¦\localnumeral*{page}¦ yields \textarabic{\localnumeral*{page}}.

For scripts with alphanumeric numbering, the variants \Cmd{\Localnumeral} and \Cmd{\Localnumeral*} provide the uppercased
versions.\medskip

\noindent All these macros provide the following options:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \DescribeMacro{[lang=]}\xpgchoicekey{lang}{\xpgpresetvalue{local}, \xpgvalue{main},
	or \xpgvalue{\meta{language}}}
		Output number in the local form of the currently active language for
		¦local¦, the main language of the document for ¦main¦, and any (loaded)
		language for \meta{language} (\eg ¦\localnumeral[lang=arabic]{42}}¦).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Non-Western decimal digits}\label{sec:decdigit}

In addition\new{1.1.1} to the generic macros described above, \pkg{polyglossia} provides language-specific conversion macros
which can be used if the generic ones do not suit the need.\footnote{%
A third method are so-called TECKit fontmappings.
Those can be activated with the \pkg{fontspec} ¦Mapping¦ option,
using ¦arabicdigits¦, ¦farsidigits¦ or ¦thaidigits¦.
For instance if \cmd\arabicfont\ is defined with the option ¦Mapping=arabicdigits¦,
typing \cmd{\textarabic\{2010\}} results in \textarabic{٢٠١٠}. Note that this method has some drawbacks, though,
for instance when the value of a counter has to be written and read from auxiliary files.
So please use this with care.}
The macros have the form \cmd{\⟨script⟩digits}. They convert Arabic numerical input and leave every other input untouched.
In an Arabic context, for instance, ¦\arabicdigits{9182/738543-X}¦ yields \textarabic{\arabicdigits{9182/738543-X}}.

Currently, the following macros are provided:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \Cmd\arabicdigits
	\item \Cmd\bengalidigits
	\item \Cmd\devanagaridigits
	\item \Cmd\farsidigits
	\item \Cmd\kannadadigits
	\item \Cmd\khmerdigits
	\item \Cmd\laodigits
	\item \Cmd\nkodigits
	\item \Cmd\thaidigits
	\item \Cmd\tibetandigits
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Non-Latin alphabetic numbering}\label{abjad}

For languages which use special (non-Latin) alphanumerical notation\footnote{%
	For instance, see \url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_numerals},
	\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abjad_numerals},
	\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_numerals},
	and \url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syriac_alphabet}.}, dedicated macros are provided.

They work in a similar way than the \cmd{\⟨script⟩digits} macros described above: They take Arabic numerical input
and output the respective value in the local alphabetic numbering scheme (most of these macros are equivalent
to \cmd\localnumeral\ and \cmd\Localnumeral\ in the respective context).

The following macros are provided:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \Cmd\abjad outputs Arabic \textit{abjad} numbers according to the Mashriq varieties.
			Example: ¦\abjad{1863}¦ yields \textarabic{\abjad{1863}}.
			
	\item \Cmd\abjadmaghribi outputs Arabic \textit{abjad} numbers according to the Maghrib varieties.
			Example: ¦\abjadmaghribi{1863}¦ yields \textarabic{\abjadmaghribi{1863}}.
			
	\item \Cmd\abjadsyriac outputs Syriac abjad numerals.\footnote{%
				A fine guide to numerals in Syriac can be found at \link{http://www.garzo.co.uk/documents/syriac-numerals.pdf}.}\\
			Example: ¦\abjadsyriac{463}¦ yields \textsyriac{\abjadsyriac{463}}.
	
	\item \Cmd\armeniannumeral produces Armenian alphabetic numbering.
	          Example: ¦\armeniannumeral{1863}¦ yields \textarmenian{\armeniannumeral{1863}}.
	          
	\item \Cmd\belarusiannumeral produces Belarusian numbering, with uppercased variant (for alphanumerical variant) via \Cmd\Belarusiannumeral.
	          Depending on the ¦numerals¦ option in the Belarusian language selection, this is either Arabic digit or Cyrillic
	          alphanumercial output.\\
	          Example: With ¦numerals=latin¦ ¦\belarusiannumeral{19}¦ yields \textrussian{\russiannumeral{19}},
	          with ¦numerals=cyrillic-trad¦ ¦\belarusiannumeral{19}¦ results in \textrussian[numerals=cyrillic-trad]{\russiannumeral{19}},\\
	          with ¦numerals=cyrillic-alph¦ ¦\belarusiannumeral{19}¦ results in \textrussian[numerals=cyrillic-alph]{\russiannumeral{19}}.

	\item \Cmd\georgiannumeral produces Georgian alphabetic numbering.\\
              Example: ¦\georgiannumeral{1863}¦ yields \textgeorgian{\georgiannumeral{1863}}.

	\item \Cmd\greeknumeral produces Greek alphabetic numbering, \Cmd\Greeknumeral outputs uppercased variants.
			Example: ¦\greeknumeral{1863}¦ yields \textgreek{\greeknumeral{1863}},
			¦\Greeknumeral{1863}¦ results in \textgreek{\Greeknumeral{1863}}.

	\item \Cmd\hebrewnumeral, \Cmd\Hebrewnumeral and \Cmd\Hebrewnumeralfinal generate variants of Hebrew alphanumeric numerals.
			The commands behave exactly as they do in \pkg{babel}: \cmd\hebrewnumeral\ outputs the numbers without any decoration,
			\cmd\Hebrewnumeral\ adds \textit{gereshayim} before the last letter, \cmd\Hebrewnumeralfinal\ uses in addition the final forms of Hebrew letters.
			Examples:
			¦\hebrewnumeral{1750}¦ yields \texthebrew{\hebrewnumeral{1750}},
			¦\Hebrewnumeral{1750}¦ yields \texthebrew{\Hebrewnumeral{1750}},
			and ¦\Hebrewnumeralfinal{1750}¦ yields \texthebrew{\Hebrewnumeralfinal{1750}}.
			
	\item \Cmd\mongoliannumeral produces Mongolian numbering, with uppercased variant (for alphanumerical variant) via \Cmd\Mongoliannumeral.
            Depending on the ¦numerals¦ option in the Mongolian language selection, this is either Arabic digit or Cyrillic
            alphanumercial output.\\
            Example: With ¦numerals=latin¦ ¦\mongoliannumeral{19}¦ yields \textrussian{\russiannumeral{19}},
            with ¦numerals=cyrillic-trad¦ ¦\mongoliannumeral{19}¦ results in \textrussian[numerals=cyrillic-trad]{\russiannumeral{19}},\\
            with ¦numerals=cyrillic-alph¦ ¦\mongoliannumeral{19}¦ results in \textrussian[numerals=cyrillic-alph]{\russiannumeral{19}}.
	
	\item \Cmd\russiannumeral produces Russian numbering, with uppercased variant (for alphanumerical variant) via \Cmd\Russiannumeral.
	        Depending on the ¦numerals¦ option in the Russian language selection, this is either Arabic digit or Cyrillic
	        alphanumercial output.\\
	        Example: With ¦numerals=latin¦ ¦\russiannumeral{19}¦ yields \textrussian{\russiannumeral{19}},
	        with ¦numerals=cyrillic-trad¦ ¦\russiannumeral{19}¦ results in \textrussian[numerals=cyrillic-trad]{\russiannumeral{19}},\\
	        with ¦numerals=cyrillic-alph¦ ¦\russiannumeral{19}¦ results in \textrussian[numerals=cyrillic-alph]{\russiannumeral{19}}.
			
	\item \Cmd\serbiannumeral produces Serbian numbering, with uppercased variant (for alphanumerical variant) via \Cmd\Serbiannumeral.
		    Depending on the ¦numerals¦ option in the Serbian language selection, this is either Arabic digit or Cyrillic
		    alphanumercial output.\\
		    Example: With ¦numerals=latin¦ ¦\serbiannumeral{19}¦ yields \textrussian{\serbiannumeral{19}},
			with ¦numerals=cyrillic-trad¦ ¦\serbiannumeral{19}¦ results in \textrussian[numerals=cyrillic-trad]{\serbiannumeral{19}},\\
			with ¦numerals=cyrillic-alph¦ ¦\serbiannumeral{19}¦ results in \textrussian[numerals=cyrillic-alph]{\serbiannumeral{19}}.
			
	\item \Cmd\ukrainiannumeral produces Ukrainian numbering, with uppercased variant (for alphanumerical variant) via \Cmd\Ukrainiannumeral.
			Depending on the ¦numerals¦ option in the Ukrainian language selection, this is either Arabic digit or Cyrillic
			alphanumercial output.\\
			Example: With ¦numerals=latin¦ ¦\ukrainiannumeral{19}¦ yields \textrussian{\russiannumeral{19}},
			with ¦numerals=cyrillic-trad¦ ¦\ukrainiannumeral{19}¦ results in \textrussian[numerals=cyrillic-trad]{\russiannumeral{19}},\\
			with ¦numerals=cyrillic-alph¦ ¦\ukrainiannumeral{19}¦ results in \textrussian[numerals=cyrillic-alph]{\russiannumeral{19}}.
\end{itemize}


\section{Footnotes in right-to-left context}

With languages that use right-to-left scripts, footnote apparatuses are usually placed at the right side of the page bottom.
Consequently, the footnote rule also is to be placed right. Things get more tricky, though, if right-to-left and left-to-right
scripts are mixed. Then you might want to put the footnotes on some pages left, on some right, or even mix positions on a page.
Thus, footnote handling in right-to-left context sometimes needs manual intervention. This is described in what follows.

\subsection{Horizontal footnote position}

When right-to-left languages are used, the \cmd\footnote\ command becomes sensitive to the text directionality. The footnote is
always placed on the side that is currently the origin of direction: on the left side of the page in LTR paragraphs and
on the right in RTL paragraphs.

For cases where this is not desired, two additional footnote commands are provided: \Cmd\RTLfootnote and \Cmd\LTRfootnote.
\cmd\LTRfootnote\ always places the footnote on the left side, notwithstanding the current
directionality. Likewise, \cmd\RTLfootnote\ always places it on the right side. Like \cmd\footnote, \cmd\RTLfootnote\
and \cmd\LTRfootnote\ provide an optional argument to customize the number.


\subsection{Footnote rule length and position}

The default placement of the footnote rule differs in \XeTeX\ and \LuaTeX\ output (this is due to differences in the \textsf{bidi}
and \textsf{luabidi} packages). With \XeTeX, footnote rules are always placed left, which is often wrong in RTL context.
With \LuaTeX, by contrast, the rule is placed always right if the main language is a right-to-left language, and always left
if the main language is a left-to-right language, which is the right thing in many cases.

In both cases, you can change the default behavior as follows:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Put \Cmd\leftfootnoterule in the preamble to have all rules left-aligned.
	\item Put \Cmd\rightfootnoterule in the preamble to have all rules right-aligned.
	\item Put \Cmd\autofootnoterule in the preamble to have automatic placement depending on the context (see below for elaboration).
	\item Put \Cmd\textwidthfootnoterule in the preamble to have a rule that spans the whole text width.
\end{itemize}
With \cmd\autofootnoterule, the first footnote on the current page determines the placement. Note that this automatic can fail with
footnotes at page boundaries that differ in directionality from the first footnote on the page. You can work around such cases by switching to \cmd\rightfootnoterule\ or \cmd\leftfootnoterule\ on these pages.

Note also that the rule switches might interfere in bad ways with packages or classes that redefine footnotes themselves. This is also the reason
why \cmd\autofootnoterule\ is not used by default.

\condbreak{5\baselineskip}
\section{Calendars}

\subsection{Hebrew calendar (hebrewcal.sty)}
The package \file{hebrewcal.sty} is almost a verbatim copy of \file{hebcal.sty}
that comes with \pkg{babel}.
The command \Cmd\Hebrewtoday\ formats the current date in the Hebrew calendar
(depending of the current writing direction this will automatically set either
in Hebrew script or in roman transliteration).

\subsection{Islamic calendar (hijrical.sty)}
This package computes dates in the lunar Islamic (Hijra) calendar.\footnote{ %
	It makes use of the arithmetical algorithm in chapter 6 of
	Reingold \& Gershowitz, \textit{Calendrical calculation: the Millenium edition}
	(Cambridge University Press, 2001).\label{reingold}}
It provides two macros for the end-user.
The command
	\displaycmd{\HijriFromGregorian\marg{year}\marg{month}\marg{day}}{\HijriFromGregorian}
sets the counters ¦Hijriday¦, ¦Hijrimonth¦ and ¦Hijriyear¦.
\Cmd\Hijritoday\ formats the Hijri date for the current day.
This command is now locale-aware\new{1.1.1}: its output will differ depending on the
currently active language. Presently \pkg{polyglossia}’s language definition files
for Arabic, Farsi, Urdu, Turkish and Malay provide a localized version of \cmd\Hijritoday.
If the formatting macro for the current language is undefined, the Hijri date will be formatted
in Arabic or in roman transliteration, depending of the current writing direction.
You can define a new format or redefine one with the command
  \displaycmd{\DefineHijriDateFormat\marg{lang}\marg{code}.}{\DefineHijriDateFormat}

The command \cmd\Hijritoday\ also accepts an optional argument to add or subtract a correction
(in days) to the date computed by the arithmetical algorithm.\footnote{ %
	The Islamic calendar is indeed a purely lunar calendar based on the observation
	of the first visibility of the lunar crescent at the beginning of the lunar month,
	so there can be differences between different localities, as well as between
	civil and religious authorities.}
For instance if \cmd\Hijritoday\ yields the date “7 Rajab 1429” (which is the date that was
displayed on the front page of \href{http://www.aljazeera.net}{aljazeera.net} on
11th July 2008), ¦\Hijritoday[1]¦ would rather print “8 Rajab 1429” (the date
indicated the same day on the site \href{http://www.gulfnews.com}{gulfnews.com}).

\subsection{Farsi (jalālī) calendar (farsical.sty)}
This package is an almost verbatim copy of ¦Arabiftoday.sty¦ (in the \pkg{Arabi} package),
itself a slight modification of ¦ftoday.sty¦ in Farsi\TeX.\footnote{ %
	One day we may rewrite \pkg{farsical} from scratch using the algorithm in
	Reingold \& Gershowitz (ref.~n.\,\ref{reingold}).}
Here we have renamed the command \cmd\ftoday\ to
\Cmd\Jalalitoday.
Example: today is \Jalalitoday.


\section{Auxiliary commands}

The macro \displaycmd{\charifavailable\marg{char code}\marg{substitution}}{\charifavailable}\new{1.47} checks whether
the character with the specified \meta{char code} (\ie unicode utf-16 code without preceding ¦0x¦) exists in
the current font. If so, the character is printed, if not, the \meta{substitution} is printed.

Example: ¦\charifavailable{1E9E}{SS}¦ prints the capital version of the German letter ⟨ß⟩ if available
(\ie \charifavailable{1E9E}{SS}), else it prints the substitution digraph SS.


\section{Accessing language information}

The following is specifically relevant to package authors who need information about the languages in use.
In order to get such information, \pkg{polyglossia} provides the following macros:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \Cmd\languagename\ stores the currently active (polyglossia) language name.
	\item \Cmd\mainlanguagename\ stores the (polyglossia) language name of the main document language.
	\item \Cmd\languagevariant\ stores the language variant if set. The macro is empty if no variant has been set.
	\item \Cmd\mainlanguagevariant\ stores the language variant of the main document language if set.
	       The macro is empty if no variant has been set.
	\item \Cmd\babelname\ stores the corresponding name of the currently active language (variant) in \pkg{babel}.
	      This might not only be useful if you want to support both \pkg{babel} and \pkg{polyglossia}, but also
	      since this name is unique for a given language variety (\eg ngerman, german, swissgerman etc.).
	      Note that this macro is also defined for languages that are not supported in \pkg{babel}. In that
	      case, they are equal to the polyglossia language name.
	\item \Cmd\mainbabelname\ analogously stores the name of document's main language (variant) in \pkg{babel}.
	\item \Cmd{\languageid\marg{type}}\new{1.47} stores the identifier tag of the current language. Currently supported \meta{types}:
	      \begin{itemize}
	      	\item ¦bcp-47¦ (alias ¦bcp47¦): IETF BCP-47 language identifier
	      \end{itemize}
	 \item \Cmd{\mainlanguageid\marg{type}}\new{1.47} stores identifier tag of the main language. Currently supported \meta{types}:
	      see \cmd\languageid.
\end{itemize}
\bigskip

\noindent If you want to have a full list of loaded languages/variants, use the following macros:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \Cmd{\xpg@loaded}\ stores a comma-separated list of all loaded languages (polyglossia name)
	\item \Cmd{\xpg@vloaded}\ stores a comma-separated list of all loaded variants
	\item \Cmd{\xpg@bloaded}\ stores a comma-separated list of \pkg{babel} names of all language variants
	\item \Cmd{\xpg@bcp@loaded}\new{1.47}\ stores a comma-separated list of the BCP-47 IDs of all language variants
\end{itemize}
\bigskip

\noindent Whether a language is loaded can be tested by
\displaycmd{\iflanguageloaded\marg{lang}\marg{true}\marg{false}}{\iflanguageloaded}
where \texttt{\meta{lang}} is a \pkg{polyglossia} language name, by
\displaycmd{\ifbabellanguageloaded\marg{lang}\marg{true}\marg{false}}{\ifbabellanguageloaded}
where \texttt{\meta{lang}} is a \pkg{babel} language name (see table~\ref{tab:bbllang} on p.~\pageref{tab:bbllang}), or by
\displaycmd{\iflanguageidloaded\marg{type}\marg{id}\marg{true}\marg{false}}{\iflanguageidloaded}\new{1.47}
where \meta{type} is a supported language id type (such as ¦bcp-47¦) and \meta{id} is a language id
(such as ¦en-US¦; see table~\ref{tab:BCP47-polyglossia} on p.~\pageref{tab:BCP47-polyglossia}).
\bigskip

\noindent Finally, if you want to know whether a specific language option has been set, you can use
\displaycmd{\iflanguageoption\marg{lang}\marg{opt. key}\marg{opt. value}\marg{true}\marg{false}}{\iflanguageoption}\new{1.47}

\section{Acknowledgements (by François Charette)}
\pkg{Polyglossia} is notable for being a recycle box of previous contributions
by other people. I take this opportunity to thank the following individuals,
whose splendid work has made my task almost trivial in comparision: \TA{Johannes
Braams} and the numerous contributors to the \pkg{babel} package (in particular
\TA{Boris Lavva} and others for its Hebrew support), \TA{Alexej Kryukov} (\pkg{antomega}),
\TA{Will Robertson} (\pkg{fontspec}), \TA{Apostolos Syropoulos} (\pkg{xgreek}), \TA{Youssef Jabri}
(\pkg{arabi}), and \TA{Vafa Khalighi} (\pkg{xepersian} and \pkg{bidi}).
The work of \TA{Mojca Miklavec} and \TA{Arthur Reutenauer} on hyphenation patterns with their package
\pkg{hyph-utf8} is of course invaluable. I should also thank other
individuals for their assistance in supporting specific languages: \TA{Yves Codet}
(Sanskrit), \TA{Zdenĕk Wagner} (Hindi), \TA{Mikhal Oren} (Hebrew), \TA{Sergey Astanin} (Russian),
\TA{Khaled Hosny} (Arabic), \TA{Sertaç Ö. Yıldız} (Turkish), \TA{Kamal Abdali} (Urdu),
and several other members of the \XeTeX\ user community, notably \TA{Enrico Gregorio}, who
has sent me many useful suggestions and corrections and contributed the \cmd\newXeTeXintercharclass\
mechanism in xelatex.ini which is now used by polyglossia.
More recently, \TA{Kevin Godby} of the \href{http://ubuntu-manual.org}{Ubuntu Manual} project has
contributed very useful feedback, bug hunting and, with the help of translators,
new language definition files for Asturian, Lithuanian, Occitan, Bengali, Malayalam, Marathi, Tamil, and Telugu.
It is particularly heartening to realize that this package is used to typeset a widely-read
document in dozens of different languages!
Support for Lao was also added thanks to \TA{Brian Wilson}.
I also thank \TA{Alan Munn} for kindly proof-reading the penultimate version of this documentation.
And of course my gratitude also goes to \TA{Jonathan Kew}, the formidable author of \XeTeX!
