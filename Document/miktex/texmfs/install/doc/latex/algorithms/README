The "algorithms" bundle provides two environments, "algorithmic" and
"algorithm", which are designed to be used together but may be used
separately.

The "algorithmic" environment provides an environment for describing
algorithms and the "algorithm" environment provides a "float" wrapper
for algorithms (implemented using "algorithmic" or some other method at
the author's option).

The reason that two environments are provided is to allow the author
maximum flexibility.

The algorithms bundle is (currently) licensed under the Lesser GPL
license, which is a Free Software license. It may, in the future, be
released under the standard LaTeX license (the Latex Project Public
License).
