This work has the LPPL maintenance status `maintained'.

The Current Maintainer of this work is Wolfgang Jeltsch.

This work consists of all files found at

    <http://darcs.wolfgang.jeltsch.info/tex/ucs/>

including subdirectories.

The following extensions to the LPPL apply for this work:

    - A distribution may omit the files data/uninames.dat and
      ucs-doc.dvi

    - The directory structure may be changed

    - A distribution may split the package into smaller packages, as
      long as this fact is visible to the user and the user may easily
      install the complete UCS package (e.g. by installing all small
      packages).

    - The data/uni-*.def files may be regenerated via makeunidef.pl from
      a valid set of config/*.def files without changing the former's
      names, whereby a valid set of config/*.ucf files consists of the
      original files and any local additions in separate files, whereby
      any characters defined in these should only be accessible via an
      option which starts with the five letters 'local'. (See the
      documentation files for a description of the technical terms and
      names in this paragraph.)

    - Files in the unsupported/ directory may be omitted.

    - Scripts (i.e. executable files which are not TeX input), may be
      renamed, as long as the original name without suffix is part of
      the new name (e.g. discovermacro.pl -> latex-ucs-discovermacro)
      and as long this is stated in some documentation file shipped with
      the distribution. Occurrences of the scripts' names in the
      documentation may be changed to match the new name.

    - Parts of files explicitly marked as "configuration data" may be
      changed by distributions, as long this is stated in a comment near
      the place of that modification and in some documentation file
      shipped with the distribution.
