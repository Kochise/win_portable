This version of pst-node uses the xkeyval package, the extended
version of keyval.

Save the files pst-node.sty|.tex|.pro in a directory, which is part of your 
local TeX node. Then do not forget to run texhash to update this node
if these packages are new to your TeX distribution.

pst-node needs pstricks, which should be part of your
local TeX installation, otherwise get it from a CTAN server, f.ex.
http://mirror.ctan.org/graphics/pstricks/

The documentation was build with a temporary file to
insert the pages from the original documentation via
the command \includepdf[pages=..]{pst-docfull}.
