Subject: ANNOUNCE: Xpdf 4.03 - a PDF viewer and related tools

Glyph & Cog, LLC is pleased to announce a new version of Xpdf, the
open source Portable Document Format (PDF) viewer.  The Xpdf project
also includes a PDF text extractor, PDF-to-PostScript converter, and
various other utilities.

Xpdf uses the Qt toolkit and runs on Linux and Windows.  The
non-graphical components (pdftops, pdftotext, etc.) run on Linux,
Unix, Windows, MacOSX, and pretty much any other system with a decent
C++ compiler.

4.03 is primarily a bug fix release.  There are some new features:

* XpdfReader improvements:
  - Implemented selection extension via shift-click, and word/line
    selection via double/triple click.
  - Added default bindings for ctrl-mousewheel-up/down to zoom in/out.
  - Added a help menu item that shows all of the key bindings.

* Various new command line options for pdftotext, pdftohtml, pdftoppm,
  pdftopng, and xpdf.

See the `CHANGES' file for a complete list of changes.

Source (C++ and C) is available, and it should be fairly easy to
compile for Linux and Windows.

More information, source code, and precompiled binaries are on the
xpdf web page:
