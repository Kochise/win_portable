This is version 2.5, a 2020 update of the wasy fonts of 1990.

The font wasy contains all lasy characters (by L.Lamport, copyright
notice in lasychr.mf), and a lot more symbols.  Provided are the
Metafont files for 5-10pt, and bold and slanted 10pt fonts, together
with a tex and pdf documentation, and a file for using the fonts
in a PLAIN-TeX document.

Type-1 fonts by Michael Sharpe and Taco Hoekwater are available
as separate package wasy-type1.

A LaTeX implementation is in the separate package wasysym by Axel
Kielhorn.

The files of this package (wasy2.4) are hereby released into the public
domain. Permission is granted to use and/or distribute these files.
Extensions and modifications should be restricted to those that are
downward compatible with this release.
