See manifest.txt for a list of all the files in the distribution.

The document classes amsart, amsbook, amsproc and related packages are
provided by the American Mathematical Society for authors to use with
LaTeX.  They produce the overall layout and appearance of AMS
publications.

In order to use an AMS document class you need to have TeX software
installed first.  TeX is not an AMS product. If you need information
on getting TeX see one of the following:

  http://www.tug.org/
  https://www.ams.org/tex/tex-resources.html

User documentation for the AMS document classes is contained in the
class-specific AMS Author Handbook, found at these locations:

  https://www.ams.org/tex/author-handbook  (individual handbooks)
  http://mirror.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/amscls-doc.zip  (full source)

Additional documentation for the AMS document classes and the related
theorem package is found in

  diffs-c.txt
  amsthdoc.pdf
  thmtest.tex
  thmtest.pdf

which are included in the collection.  Answers to some specific
questions can be found in the AMS Author FAQ:

  https://www.ams.org/tex/amsclass-faq.html

The recommended procedure for making a custom document class based on an
AMS class is to make a copy of the relevant .cls file using a different
name and edit the copy---e.g., copy amsbook.cls to mybook.cls.  (In
general we advise against using \LoadClass, unless the base class is
frozen or changes to the base class are under your control.)
