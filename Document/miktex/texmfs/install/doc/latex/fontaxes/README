fontaxes - Additional font axes for LaTeX
=========================================

The fontaxes package adds several new font axes on top of LaTeX's New Font
Selection Scheme. In particular, it splits the shape axis into a primary and
a secondary shape axis, and it adds three new axes to deal with the different
figure versions offered by many professional fonts.

Usage
-----

To use this package, include

    \usepackage{fontaxes}

in the preamble of your LaTeX document. See the PDF documentation for details.

Installation
------------

1. Run `latex fontaxes.ins` to generate the LaTeX package.

2. Create the following directories in a local texmf tree:

   - doc/latex/fontaxes
   - tex/latex/fontaxes

3. Copy all necessary files into the texmf tree:

   - fontaxes.pdf and test-fontaxes.tex go to doc/latex/fontaxes
   - fontaxes.sty goes to tex/latex/fontaxes

4. Afterwards, you may need to regenerate the file database:

    texhash
