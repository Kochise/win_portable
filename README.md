Some useful Windows programs in one portable package

**7-Zip** : multi format un/packer, lightweight and free (no nag screen)
**Accessoires** : Wordpad (XP version, the best, with ruler and preview)
**AdwCleaner** : remove adwares and stuff
**A's Video Converter** : not the easiest video converter to use, but the fastest
**CapsUnlock** : prevent Capslock from locking (also press Shift for that)
**CrossHair** : Ctrl+& to des/activate locked (Ctrl+² for dynamic)
**Dia** : Visio-like diagram editor
**DirectShutdown** : Windows+r restart, Windows+s shutdown (not on Windows 10)
**DragLock** : Windows+mouse movement lock it vertical or horizontal
**Elm** : web functional language (inspired from Haskel)
**Erlang** : distributed functional language (inspired from Prolog)
**FileZilla** : ftp client (better use Total Commander in passive mode)
**Firefox** : ready to use Firefox browser with some privacy extensions installed
**IrfanView** : image viewer and more, light image editing with F12
**JoyToKey** : as the name says, transform joystick into keyboard moves
**Keyboard Status** : display the status of Capslock and Numlock
**K-Lite Codec Pack** : the codecs everyone should install, don't mess with vlc
**LastActivityView** : we know what you did last summer
**LICEcap** : record a part of your screen directly into animated gif
**lite** : lite source code editor coded in lua
**MyDefrag** : best defragger, select System Disk Monthly, then your Windows disk
**Notepad++** : the editor with some extensions installed
**Notepad2-mod** : the editor 2 (Alt+z or Alt+o are best there)
**NumLocker** : like Capsunlock but for Numlock (doesn't work on Windows 10)
**paint.net** : the better Paint or Gimp, with layers and stuff
**Picat** : sat based functional language (inspired from B-Prolog)
**PrivaZer** : remove trails and stuff
**PureText** : Windows+v paste raw text without formatting
**RogueKiller** : detect and remove rootkits
**ShutUp10** : set predefined Windows 10 settings (like no telemetry)
**Sourcetrail** : explore source code hierarchy (steep learning curve)
**Subtitle Edit** : best subtitle editor, can shift time for several lines
**SuperFastClicker** : console program, press Ctrl for mouse fast clicking
**SysinternalsSuite** : the stuff that should be with every Windows
**Total Commander** : the stuff that should replace Windows
**TreeSheets** : strange hierarchical notepad (inspired by Inception)
**TTYEmulator** : the best tty emulator, do ssh as well (Linux session)
**WinMerge** : the file comparator and merger, as good as kdiff3

In each folder a url file links the original source (might be obsolete, use web.archive.org to get there).
Cannot add **Firefox** right now because one dll file is larger than 100MB (wtf seriously).
