\section{\STIX\ table data extraction}\label{part:awk}

The source for the \TeX\ names for the very large number of mathematical
glyphs are provided via Barbara Beeton's table file for the \STIX\ project
(|ams.org/STIX|). A version is located at
|http://www.ams.org/STIX/bnb/stix-tbl.asc|
but check |http://www.ams.org/STIX/| for more up-to-date info.

This table is converted into a form suitable for reading by \TeX.
A single file is produced containing all (more than 3298) symbols.
Future optimisations might include generating various (possibly overlapping) subsets
so not all definitions must be read just to redefine a small range of symbols.
Performance for now seems to be acceptable without such measures.

This file is currently developed outside this DTX file. It will be
incorporated when the final version is ready. (I know this is not how
things are supposed to work!)
