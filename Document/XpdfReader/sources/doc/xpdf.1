.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Xpdf
is a viewer for Portable Document Format (PDF) files.  (These are also
sometimes also called \'Acrobat' files, from the name of Adobe's PDF
software.)  Xpdf uses the Qt GUI toolkit and runs on Unix, OS X, and
Windows.
.PP
To run xpdf, type:
.PP
.RS
xpdf file.pdf
.RE
.PP
where
.I file.pdf
is your PDF file.  The file name can be followed by a page number to
be displayed, prefixed with a colon:
.PP
.RS
xpdf file.pdf :18
.RE
.PP
or by a named destination, prefixed with \'+' (this is only useful
with PDF files that provide named destination targets):
.PP
.RS
xpdf file.pdf +destinationA
.RE
.PP
If you specify multiple files, they will each be opened in a separate
tab:
.PP
.RS
xpdf file1.pdf file2.pdf :18 file3.pdf
.RE
.PP
You can also start xpdf without opening any files:
.PP
.RS

.RE
.SH CONFIGURATION FILE
Xpdf reads a configuration file at startup.  It first tries to find
the user's private config file, ~/.xpdfrc.  If that doesn't exist, it
looks for a system-wide config file, typically /usr/local/etc/xpdfrc
(but this location can be changed when xpdf is built).  See the
.BR xpdfrc (5)
man page for details.
.SH OPTIONS
The following command line options are available.  All command line
options must come before any PDF files to be opened.
.PP
Many of the options can be set with configuration file commands.
These are listed in square brackets with the description of the
corresponding command line option.
.TP
.BI \-geometry " geometry"
Set the initial window geometry.
.TP
.BI \-title " title"
Set the window title.  By default, the title will be "xpdf: foo.pdf".
.TP
.BI \-open " \fR[\fPPDF-file\fR]\fP"
This option sets up a default remote server.  If Xpdf is already
running (with the "-open" switch), the PDF file (if any) is opened in
a new tab.  If Xpdf (with the "-open" switch) is not already running,
starts Xpdf and opens the PDF file (if any).  This is useful for GUI
desktop environments, e.g., the typical double-click on a PDF file
case.
.TP
.B \-rv
Set reverse video mode.  This reverses the colors of everything except
images.  It may not always produce great results for PDF files which
do weird things with color.  This also causes the paper color to
default to black.
.TP
.BI \-papercolor " color"
Set the "paper color", i.e., the background of the page display.  The
color can be #RRGGBB (hexadecimal) or a named color.  This option will
not work well with PDF files that do things like filling in white
behind the text.
.RB "[config file: " paperColor ]
.TP
.BI \-mattecolor " color"
Set the matte color, i.e., the color used for background outside the
actual page area.  The color can be #RRGGBB (hexadecimal) or a named
color.
.RB "[config file: " matteColor ]
.TP
.BI \-fsmattecolor " color"
Set the matte color for full-screen mode.  The color can be #RRGGBB
(hexadecimal) or a named color.
.RB "[config file: " fullScreenMatteColor ]
.TP
.BI \-z " zoom"
Set the initial zoom factor.  A number specifies a zoom percentage,
where 100 means 72 dpi.  You may also specify \'page', to fit the page
to the window size, or \'width', to fit the page width to the window
width.
.RB "[config file: " initialZoom ]
.TP
.BI \-aa " yes | no"
Enable or disable font anti-aliasing.  This defaults to "yes".
.RB "[config file: " antialias ]
.TP
.BI \-aaVector " yes | no"
Enable or disable vector anti-aliasing.  This defaults to "yes".
.RB "[config file: " vectorAntialias ]
.TP
.BI \-enc " encoding-name"
Sets the encoding to use for text output.  The
.I encoding\-name
must be defined with the unicodeMap command (see
.BR xpdfrc (5)).
This defaults to "Latin1" (which is a built-in encoding).
.RB "[config file: " textEncoding ]
.TP
.BI \-pw " password"
Specify the password for the PDF file.  This can be either the owner
password (which will bypass all security restrictions) or the user
password.
.TP
.B \-fullscreen
Open xpdf in full-screen mode, useful for presentations.
.TP
.BI \-remote " remote-name"
Start Xpdf in remote server mode.  See the REMOVE SERVER MODE section.
.TP
.BI \-display " display"
Set the X display (only available with X11).
.TP
.B \-cmd
Print commands as they're executed (useful for debugging).
.RB "[config file: " printCommands ]
.TP
.BI \-cfg " config-file"
Read
.I config-file
in place of ~/.xpdfrc or the system-wide config file.
.TP
.B \-v
Print copyright and version information.
.TP
.B \-h
Print usage information.
.RB ( \-help
and
.B \-\-help
are equivalent.)

block selection mode.  Clicking on it toggles between the two
selection modes.
.TP
.B "page number entry box"
Move to a specific page number.  Click in the box to activate it, type
the page number, then hit return.  This will instead display and
accept page labels, if the "view - page labels" menu item is checked.
.TP
.B "left/right arrow buttons"
Go backward or forward along the history path.
.TP
.B "zoom out/in buttons"

words (on/off).
.PP
.SS Menu bar
The menu bar is above the toolbar.  The menu items should be
self-explanatory.
.PP
.SS Tab list
The tab list is on the left, just below the toolbar.  It lists all
open tabs.
.PP
.SS Outline/layers/attachments pane
This pane is on the left, below the tab list.  The popup allows you to
select from outline, layers, or attachments.
.PP
The outline is a tree-like structure of bookmarks that allows moving
within the PDF file.  Not all PDF files have outlines.
.PP
Layers (a.k.a. optional content) allow parts of the PDF content to be
shown or hidden.  Not all PDF files have layers.
.PP
Attachments are other files embedded within the PDF file.  There is
a 'save' button for each attached file.  Not all PDF files have
attachments.
.PP
.SS Text selection
Dragging the mouse with the left button held down will highlight an
arbitrary rectangle.  Selected text can be copied to the clipboard
(with the edit/copy menu item).  On X11, selected text will be
available in the X selection buffer.
.PP
.SS Links
When the mouse is over a hyperlink, the link target will be shown in a
popup near the bottom of the window.
.PP
Clicking on a hyperlink will jump to the link's destination.  A link
to another PDF document will make xpdf load that document.  A
\'launch' link to an executable program will display a dialog, and if
you click \'ok', execute the program.  URL links are opened in a
system-dependent way.  (On UNIX, Qt uses the $BROWSER environment
variable.)
.PP
.SS Mouse bindings
The left mouse button is used to select text (see above).
.PP
Clicking on a link with the middle button opens the link in a new tab.
.PP
Dragging the mouse with the middle button held down pans the window.
.PP
The right mouse button opens a popup menu (see
.BR popupMenuCmd " in " xpdfrc (5)).

    %b => PDF file base name, i.e., file name minus
          the extension (or an empty string if no
          file is open)
    %u => link URL (or an empty string if not over
          a URL link)
    %p => current page number (or an empty string if
          no file is open)
    %x => selection upper-left x coordinate

    %% => %

.fi
The external command string will often contain spaces, so the whole
command must be quoted in the xpdfrc file:
.nf

    bind x "run(ls -l)"

.fi
The command string may not be run through a shell.  It is recommended
to keep the command simple, so that it doesn't depend on specific
shell functionality.  For complex things, you can have the command
string run a shell script.

.SH REMOTE SERVER MODE
Starting xpdf with the "-remote" switch puts it into remote server
mode.  All remaining command line options are commands (see the
COMMANDS section).  Subsequent invocations of "xpdf -remote" with the
same remote server name will send commands to the already-running
instance of xpdf.  The "checkOpenFile" commands are useful here for
things like changing pages.
For example:
.PP
.RS
    # Start up xpdf, and open something.pdf.
    xpdf -remote foo 'openFile(something.pdf)'

    # Switch to page 7 in the already-open something.pdf.  If the user
    # has closed xpdf in the meantime, this will restart it and reopen
    # the file.
    xpdf -remote foo 'checkOpenFileAtPage(something.pdf, 7)'
.RE
.PP
.SH EXIT CODES
