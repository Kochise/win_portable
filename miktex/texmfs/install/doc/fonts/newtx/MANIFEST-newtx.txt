This package contains extensions of the GUST TeXGyreTermes fonts, adding a full set of superior figures and lowercase letters in each style, and providing a variant form of small caps in each style that are on the order of 10% taller. The newly generated type1 fonts are:

ntxtmb.pfb
ntxtmbi.pfb
ntxtmr.pfb
ntxtmri.pfb
ntxsups-Bold.pfb
ntxsups-BoldItalic.pfb
ntxsups-Regular.pfb
ntxsups-Italic.pfb

from which a number of the newtxtext font metrics, version 1.4, were derived.
