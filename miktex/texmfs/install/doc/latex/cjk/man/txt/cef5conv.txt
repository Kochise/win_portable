CEF5CONV(1)                 General Commands Manual                CEF5CONV(1)



NAME
       cef5conv  -  convert  a  TeX  document in Big 5 encoding containing CEF
       macros into `preprocessed' form.

SYNOPSIS
       cef5conv < infile > outfile

DESCRIPTION
       The Chinese Encoding Framework (CEF)  developed  by  Christian  Wittern
       <cwittern@conline.central.de>  makes it possible to include CJK charac-
       ters in various encodings using the SGML macros &CX-aabb; for Big 5 and
       CNS encoding and &U-aabb; for Unicode (X denotes a number between 0 and
       7; 0 represents Big 5 encoding, 1-7 CNS encoding planes 1-7.   aabb  is
       either a decimal or hexadecimal number).

       cef5conv  converts  the CEF macros of a Big 5 encoded document together
       with the Big5 encoding itself into a form which can directly  processed
       with LaTeX 2e.  It is identical to

              bg5conv < infile | cefconv > outfile

       This filter is part of the CJK macro package for LaTeX 2e.
