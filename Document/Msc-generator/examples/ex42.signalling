##Entity positioning
##entity position horizontal relative
##Using the 'relative' entity attribute you can govern ordering. It places the new entity relative to the entity specified (as opposed to relative to the last entity defined). The distance is one unit by default so using 'pos' is also recommended. Note: You can also use the 'hspace' command to force entities further apart.
