  path-building changes of 1.2.0 and 1.2.1.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    added a Mach-Zehnder-Modulator block symbol as node \texttt{mzm} by

  \end{itemize}
\item
  Version 1.2.2 (2020-07-15)

  Bug-fix release: coordinate name leakage. The node and coordinate
  names are global; the internal coordinate names have been made
  stronger.
\item
  Version 1.2.1 (2020-07-06)

  Several changes, both internal and user-visible. These are quite
  risky, although they \emph{should} be backward-compatible (if the
  circuit code is correct).

  From the user point of view:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    there is now a new style of voltages (``raised American'')
  \item
    a powerful mechanism for customize voltages, current and flows has
    been added.
  \end{itemize}

  The internal changes are basically the re-implementation of the macros
  that draw the path elements (\texttt{to{[}...{]}}), which have been
  completely rewritten. Please be sure to read the possible
  incompatibilities in the manual (section 1.9).

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Added access to voltages, currents and flows anchors
  \item
    Added ``raised american'' voltage style
  \item
    Rewrite of the path generation macros
  \item
    Several small bugs fixed (no one ever used some
    ``f\^{}\textgreater{}'' options\ldots{})
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Version 1.2.0 (2020-06-21)

  In this release, the big change is the rewriting of the voltages
  output routine. Now all voltage options (american, european, and
  straight) take into account the shape (square border) of the
  component. The adjusting parameters are now (at least for passive
  elements) acting in similar way for all the options, too.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Bumped version number to 1.2 (potentially incompatible changes!)
  \item
    Added 1.1.2 checkpoint
  \item
    New path-style not, buffer, and Schmitt logic ports
  \item
    New tutorial (using the ``inline not'' component)
  \item
    Voltage output routine rewrite; now it takes into account the shape
    of the component also for ``american'' and ``straight'' voltages
  \item
    Several fixes in the logic ports: fixed IEEE \texttt{invschmitt}
    name, added symmetry to the three-style shorthands for the ports,
    and so on
  \item
    Fixed a gross bug in square poles anchor borders
  \item
    Fixed size of not circles in flip-flops (based on logic ports style)
  \item
    Fixed the order of initial options, to avoid ``european''
    overwriting single options
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Version 1.1.2 (2020-05-17)

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Blocks and component for three-phase networks (3-lines wire, AC/DC
    and DC/AC converters blocks and grid node block) added by user
    \texttt{@olfline} on GitHub
  \item
    added transformer sources with optional vector groups for
    three-phase networks by \texttt{@olfline} on Github
  \item
    added subsections to the examples
  \item
    fixed position of american voltages on open circuits (suggested by
    user \texttt{@rhandley} on GitHub)
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Version 1.1.1 (2020-04-24)

  One-line bugfix release for the IEEE ports ``not'' circle thickness
\item
  Version 1.1.0 (2020-04-19)

  Version bumped to 1.1 because the new logic ports are quite a big
  addition: now there is a new style for logic ports, conforming to IEEE
  recommendations.

  Several minor additions all over the map too.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    added IEEE standard logic ports suggested by user Jason-s on GitHub
  \item
    added configurability to european logic port ``not'' output symbol,
    suggested by j-hap on GitHub
  \item
    added \texttt{inerter} component by user Tadashi on GitHub
  \item
    added variable outer base height for IGBT, suggested by user RA-EE
    on GitHub
  \item
    added configurable ``+'' and ``-'' signs on american-style voltage
    generators
  \item
    text on amplifiers can be positioned to the left or centered
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Version 1.0.2 (2020-03-22)

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    added Schottky transistors (thanks to a suggestion by Jérôme
    Monclard on GitHub)
  \item
    fixed formatting of \texttt{CHANGELOG.md}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Version 1.0.1 (2020-02-22)

  Minor fixes and addition to 1.0, in time to catch the freeze for
  TL2020.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    add v1.0 version snapshots
  \item
    added crossed generic impedance (suggested by Radványi Patrik Tamás)
  \item
    added open barrier bipole (suggested by Radványi Patrik Tamás)
  \item
    added two flags to flip the direction of light's arrows on LED and
    photodiode (suggested by karlkappe on GitHub)
  \item
    added a special key to help with precision loss in case of
    fractional scaling (thanks to AndreaDiPietro92 on GitHub for
    noticing and reporting, and to Schrödinger's cat for finding a fix)
  \item
    fixed a nasty bug for the flat file generation for ConTeXt
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Version 1.0 (2020-02-04)

  And finally\ldots{} version 1.0 (2020-02-04) of \texttt{circuitikz} is
  released.

  The main updates since version 0.8.3, which was the last release
  before Romano started co-maintaining the project, are the following
  --- part coded by Romano, part by several collaborators around the
  internet:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    The manual has been reorganized and extended, with the addition of a
    tutorial part; tens of examples have been added all over the map.
  \item
    Around 74 new shapes where added. Notably, now there are chips,
    mux-demuxes, multi-terminal transistors, several types of switches,
    flip-flops, vacuum tubes, 7-segment displays, more amplifiers, and
    so on.
  \item
    Several existing shapes have been enhanced; for example, logic gates
    have a variable number of inputs, transistors are more configurable,
    resistors can be shaped more, and more.
  \item
    You can style your circuit, changing relative sizes, default
    thickness and fill color, and more details of how you like your
    circuit to look; the same you can do with labels (voltages,
    currents, names of components and so on).
  \item
    A lot of bugs have been squashed; especially the (very complex)
    voltage direction conundrum has been clarified and you can choose
    your preferred style here too.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

A detailed list of changes can be seen below.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Version 1.0.0-pre3 (not released)

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist

  \end{itemize}
\item
  Version 1.0.0-pre2 (2020-01-23)

  \textbf{Really} last additions toward the 1.0.0 version. The most
  important change is the addition of multiplexer and de-multiplexers;
  also added the multi-wires (bus) markers.

  \begin{itemize}

\item
  Version 1.0.0-pre1 (2019-12-22)

  Last additions before the long promised 1.0! In this pre-release we
  feature a flip-flop library, a revamped configurability of amplifiers
  (and a new amplifier as a bonus) and some bug fix around the clock.

    Added a flip-flop library
  \item
    Added a single-input generic amplifier with the same dimension as
    ``plain amp''

  \end{itemize}
\item
  Version 0.9.7 (2019-12-01)

  The important thing in this release is the new position of
  transistor's labels; see the manual for details.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Fix the position of transistor's text. There is an option to revert
    to the old behavior.
  \item
    Added anchors for adding circuits (like snubbers) to the flyback
    diodes in transistors (after a suggestion from @EdAlvesSilva on
    GitHub).
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Version 0.9.6 (2019-11-09)

  The highlights of this release are the new multiple terminals BJTs and
  several stylistic addition and fixes; if you like to pixel-peep, you
  will like the fixed transistors arrows. Additionally, the transformers
  are much more configurable now, the ``pmos'' and ``nmos'' elements
  have grown an optional bulk connection, and you can use the ``flow''
  arrows outside of a path.

  Several small and less small bugs have been fixed.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Added multi-collectors and multi-emitter bipolar transistors
  \item
    Added the possibility to style each one of the two coils in a
    transformer independently

    consistent way
  \item
    Fixed flow, voltage, and current arrow positioning when ``auto'' is
    active on the path

    couple of anchors
  \item
    Fixed a spelling error on op-amp key ``noinv input down''
  \item
    Fixed a problem with ``quadpoles style=inner'' and ``transformer
    core'' having the core lines running too near
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Version 0.9.5 (2019-10-12)

  This release basically add features to better control labels, voltages
  and similar text ``ornaments'' on bipoles, plus some other minor
  things.

  On the bug fixes side, a big incompatibility with ConTeXt has been
  fixed, thanks to help from \texttt{@TheTeXnician} and \texttt{@hmenke}
  on \texttt{github.com}.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Added a ``midtap'' anchor for coils and exposed the inner coils
    shapes in the transformers
  \item
    Added a ``curved capacitor'' with polarity coherent with
    ``ecapacitor''
  \item

    bipole's text ornaments (labels, annotations, voltages, currents and
    flows)
  \item
    Added the possibility to move the wiper in resistive potentiometers
  \item
    Added a command to load and set a style in one go
  \item
    Fixed internal font changing commands for compatibility with ConTeXt
  \item
    Fixed hardcoded black color in ``elko'' and ``elmech''
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Version 0.9.4 (2019-08-30)

  This release introduces two changes: a big one, which is the styling
  of the components (please look at the manual for details) and a change
  to how voltage labels and arrows are positioned. This one should be
  backward compatible \emph{unless} you used \texttt{voltage\ shift}
  introduced in 0.9.0, which was broken when using the global
  \texttt{scale} parameter.

  The styling additions are quite big, and, although in principle they
  are backward compatible, you can find corner cases where they are not,
  especially if you used to change parameters for
  \texttt{pgfcirc.defines.tex}; so a snapshot for the 0.9.3 version is
  available.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Fixed a bug with ``inline'' gyrators, now the circle will not
    overlap
  \item
    Fixed a bug in input anchors of european not ports
  \item

    Fixed the ``transistor arrows at end'' feature, added to styling
  \item
    Changed the behavior of ``voltage shift'' and voltage label
    positioning to be more robust
  \item
    Added several new anchors for ``elmech'' element
  \item
    Several minor fixes in some component drawings to allow fill and
    thickness styles
  \item
    Add 0.9.3 version snapshots.
  \item
    Added styling of relative size of components (at a global or local
    level)
  \item
    Added styling for fill color and thickeness
  \item
    Added style files
  \end{itemize}
\item

    backward-incompatibility, but smaller code, because p-channels
    mosfet are by default in the correct direction(source at top). Just
    remove the `yscale=-1' from your p-chan fets at old pictures.
