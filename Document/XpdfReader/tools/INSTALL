To install this binary package:

Copy everything to an installation directory, e.g.,
C:/Program Files/Xpdf
(this can be anywhere - it doesn't need to be in "Program Files")

Documentation for each tool is available in the 'doc' subdirectory.

The 'doc/sample-xpdfrc' file can be used as a template for 'xpdfrc',
which must be placed in the same directory as the executables.  This
configuration file is completely optional.
