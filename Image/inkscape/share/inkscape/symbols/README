Internationalization

These files are internationalized the same way as
share/filters/filters/svg The i18n.py script called from the makefile
will extract strings from the *.svg files into a *.svg.h
file. Intltool is then able to extracts these strings just like from
normal .h files.


Adding new files

Symbol files should be carefully prepared.

1. The SVG should be clean: No unnecessary transforms, sensible path
   data, etc. Do a manual inspection. Remove cruft like guide-lines,
   grids, etc.
   
2. The SVG itself needs a <title> element, placed before any <symbol>
   tags, which contains the name of the symbol set, without any
   surrounding extra spaces. The whole element needs to be on a line
   of its own. If no title element is provided, or its syntax isn't
   correct, the name of the file will be used as a label for the
   symbol set in the user interface instead.
 
3. Avoid adding unnecessary style properties in the symbol elements;
   this prevents the user from overriding the default styling by
   specifying the style on the <use> element. Default styling can be
   specified in the root SVG element. Inkscape will apply this
   styling by default in the <use> element.

4. Provide a meaningful <title> element for each symbol. This will be
   appear in the GUI as a tool-tip.

5. Make sure there are no "transform" elements in the <symbol>
   element. Transforms are not allowed per specification and are not
   supported in most browsers. ('refX' and 'refY' are allowed in SVG
   2.)

6. Add a section with <use> elements to demonstrate the symbols if the
   file is opened by itself.
