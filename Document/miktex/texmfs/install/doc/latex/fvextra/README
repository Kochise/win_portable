fvextra provides several extensions to fancyvrb, including automatic line
breaking and improved math mode.  It also patches some fancyvrb internals.
fvextra provides a reimplemented \Verb command that works (with a few
limitations) inside other commands, even in movable arguments and PDF
bookmarks.  It also provides \EscVerb, which is similar to \Verb except that
it works everywhere without limitations by allowing the backslash to serve as
an escape character.
