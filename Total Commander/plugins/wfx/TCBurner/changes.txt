--- Changes in current version -----------------------------------------------

[!] This release of TCBurner contains a new version of "FoxBurner.dll". If you
    are upgrading from a previous version, make sure this new DLL (size
    720.896 bytes, date 23.02.2005 23:14) becomes active, i.e. you overwrite
    the old DLL upon installation!
[+] Querying the properties of plugin root entries now opens the documentation
    html file at the point where the selected entry is explained
[+] The plugin itself now supports multi-language through a .locale file. Those
    are stored in a subdir "Lang" under the plugin dir. You can choose the
    language to use in the configuration dialog. You can also make your own
    language file by editing the "english.locale" file which contains some
    remarks. (If you do so, it would be nice if you sent your language file to
    the developer for distribution!).
[+] The plugin now supports .lst files created by the DiskDir plugin. If you
    copy such a file (the whole file, not some contents!) to the Data-CD/DVD
    project, you're queried if you wish the plugin to interpret the .lst as
    a list file and put all files listed in it in the project instead of the
    list file itself.
[+] Data and Audio Project contents can now be saved to disk, by executing
    pseudo-file commands, and automatically at plugin init/shutdown
[+] Volume labels are now stored separately per project type
[+] Added "default label" option: if active, after each burning process the
    chosen volume label is replaced by a default value
[+] Added separator lines between pseudo-file commands and project contents.
    Meanwhile the special pseudo-files got a little too many for my taste, so
    some separator was needed. :) I hope it will work okay for different
    ways of ordering the panel in TC.
[+] Added "Estimated Free Space" entry to project directories. Total media 
    space is either retrieved from a media inserted in a selectable burner, or
    (if not possible - no device inserted, burner busy etc.) based on a preset
    or user-definable media type (execute the Free Space pseudo-file to change
    those settings). Device/preset size is stored in configuration for each
    project type. In case of oversize, a warning icon and text is displayed.
[+] The "Info: Burning Devices" pseudo-directory now shows the type of
    inserted media (if any) for each burning device
[+] Media checks before burning (is media empty/writable/erasable?) can be 
    skipped now, so users with slightly incompatible burners that report wrong
    media information can (try to) burn anyway
[+] Added an option to use external ASPI layer. Might help in some cases with
    slightly incompatible burners.
[+] Location of configuration file can be changed from the Global Settings
    dialog. In addition the file can be moved manually anytime, even while the
    plugin is initialized, since the location to be used is evaluated each 
    time the config file needs to be written.
[+] The Burn and Erase Progress dialogs can be minimized now; the completion
    percentage is shown in the title/task bar
[+] Verify function re-made: wrote an own verify replacing the FoxBurner 
    internal one. Advantages: faster, more stable, waits for media re-insert 
    if it was ejected, can verify Data+VideoDVD Projects, verifies only files 
    actually in the project
[+] Burning log text can now also be copied to clipboard (in addition to
    saving it to a file)
[+] Configuration file is now searched for in the following folders, the first
    folder where it is found (top-down) is used. If it cannot be found, a new
    file with default settings is created in the first listed folder.
    [wincmd-ini-path]\tcburner.ini
    [wincmd-ini-path]\tcburner\tcburner.ini
    [plugin-path]\tcburner.ini
    [wincmd-path]\tcburner.ini
[*] The functions that were formerly performed with the TC Rename command
    (change volume label, re-order audio tracks) are now performed by execu-
    ting the pseudo-files. Text entry is done in a input query dialog.
[*] DVD+/-RW media don't support multisession, don't need to be erased before 
    writing (i.e. any writing operation erases existing data) and may show 
    incorrect media status ("Complete Disc" despite being empty); media checks 
    have been modified accordingly and a warning is displayed if multisession 
    burn on such a media is attempted
[*] Some static pseudo-file commands (like "Estimated Free Space" and
    "Load Project") are now shown in the project folders even if the project
    itself is empty
[*] When erasing a media from the burn dialog (when a non-empty but erasable
    media was detected), the erasing and subsequent burning is started auto-
    matically now, the Erase dialog no longer waits for user interaction
[*] Accidentially copying a whole lot of non-useable files to the Image, Audio
    or DVD project caused a great lot of error message boxes. Now a query is
    shown "show further errors/ignore further errors/abort operation?"
[*] Removed the ** from the Project pseudo-directory names; no more conflict
    with TC's quick directory change feature (where * has some special meaning)
[*] In the "Project Size" pseudo-file the size in bytes is now displayed in 
    the TC's size column. Looks better, and avoids the last "." in the byte 
    count being interpreted as file extension.
[*] The font in all dialogs has been changed from MS Sans Serif to Tahoma.
    Looks a good deal nicer.
[*] TCBurner has a new nice set of colorful alpha-blended icons
[%] Save-as-dialog for ISO file creation now displays "Overwrite?" warning if
    file already exists
[%] The commands in "Info: Burning Device" would allow you to retrieve device
    info also during a burning/erasing process, thus messing up the burning.
[%] ISO image filenames were checked case-sensitively, so only ".iso" would be
    accepted, not ".ISO" or others
[%] This version of TCBurner includes a new version of the FoxBurner SDK DLL
    which should fix the problem with Video DVDs not playing correctly on
    standalone DVD players
[-] Removed the "Data Project: Boot Image" pseudo-folder. The boot image for
    bootable CDs is now selected via a file requester after confirming the 
    Burn Media dialog.


--- Changes in previous versions ---------------------------------------------

0.9.2  (15.02.2005)

[!] Since TCBurner uses an INI file now instead of the registry to store its
    configuration data, your configuration will be reset to default if you
    upgrade from 0.9.1. I really was too lazy to include a migration 
    function. :-) You can safely remove the registry key "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\
    Software\Tiamat Software\TCBurner" if you wish to clean up a little.
[+] New burning project type: ISO/CUE Image Burning
[+] Burn speed can now be set
[+] The last used burning device is now stored in the configuration file and 
    subsequently presented as default when opening the burn/erase dialog
[+] Overburn option: if you try to burn a too large project, you now have the
    possibility to ignore it and burn anyway.
[+] Pressing F3 on the "**Show Help" command now displays the documentation
    html in TC's lister.
[+] New root command: "Rescan burning devices". Mostly useful for people with
    removable burners.
[+] Extended handling of media checks before burning: in case of empty drive,
    message is shown with opportunity to insert media. In case of non-writable
    but erasable media, erase dialog is offered.
[+] Contents of burn log window can now be saved to a text file
[+] Upon first start of each new version of the plugin, a text box with the
    changes log is now shown.
[+] Project size (bytes, duration, filecount) is now shown as a pseudo-file
    in Data and Audio Project pseudo-directories
[+] The volume label is now shown as a pseudo-file in each project pseudo-
    directory, and can be set using the TC "Rename" command (Shift-F6).
[+] New root command: "Update check". Queries newest available plugin version
    from the download website and informs the user if a newer version than
    is currently installed is available.
[*] Erasing a medium no longer blocks the TC window (except when done from
    within burn dialog)
[*] Configuration data is now stored in an INI file ("tcburner.ini" in the
    plugin's directory) instead of the registry.
[*] Better progress bar during erase. The time needed for erase is now
    estimated at first and then measured, and stored for each device and
    medium type. For details see documentation.
[*] Some improved status messages during burning
[*] Re-ordering audio tracks improved: new name can contain characters other
    than the new track number now. The first group of numeric characters will
    be used as new track number, all characters before and after it are 
    truncated.
[*] Improved speed of plugin's initialization
[*] Track duration in audio projects is now shown as "mm:ss" (minutes,
    seconds) instead of "hh:mm:ss".
[*] Creating ISO images now has an own pseudo-file command in the Data project
    pseudo-directory, and is no longer done via a special entry in the burning
    device list.
[%] The Data Project would show inaccessible files (locked by other processes
    etc.) with a "random" size (something like 60.000 terabytes :) )
[%] After decompressing MP3/OGG files for audio burning, the "Close" button
    would behave like "Abort burn" if there was an error starting the burning
    process, causing an infinite abort-query loop.
[%] Deleting multiple audio tracks at once didn't work properly due to pseudo-
    filenames changing during deletion
[%] The message "Errors occured during adding files" was displayed "the wrong
    way around" for Video DVD projects: success was shown as error, an error
    was treated as success.
