hpg_ed Version History:
=======================
V 0.5.13: (2003/08/15)
======================
FIX: (THIS TIME IT WORKS REALLY!) COMMENTS BUG IN C/C++ AND PASCAL/DELPHI
Comments were wring calculated. A line comment
like:
//**********
void ...

were not correctly parsed. Instead also the next lines were treated as comment lines. The same in PASCAL with //(*.

ADDED JUMP TO LINE AS COMMAND
So you can setup a keyboard binding to that command. Per default no hotkey is assigned.


V 0.5.12: (2003/08/13)
======================
CHANGED CURSOR BEHAVIOR PREVWORD (Ctrl-Left)
Cursor just moved to previous word until column 0. If on clumn 0 Ctrl-Left was ignored. Now the cursor moves to the last word of the previous row (if any).

NEW SAVE DIALOG
Added places bar to the save as dialog.

FIXED: NON ENGLISH SHORTCUT TEXTS
Under some strange circumstances the Shortcut texts for menus, toolbar button hints etc. would be display in German. Now all captions are builded with a plain English version.

NEW SUPPORT FOR LONG LINES
Changed the maximum number of characters from 1024 to 4096. This slows down the editor a little bit, but a lot of files I'm using may contain more lines so I decided this by myself :-)
(In next versions the number of columns should be dynamically determined).

CHANGES CONFIG DIALOGS:
Changed some config pages a little bit to make the dealing with settings a little bit easier. The "General Settings" and "Tab & Indetions" pages are changed to a treeview options dialog.

V 0.5.11:
=========
WINDOWS <-> Linux Convertings
Added new converting function. Now you can save Windows files as Linux files and vice versa. Therefor a new switch is included in the Save as dialog of hpg_ed (not the lister menu!).

Version Information Dialog
Added version information dialog that includes all important hpg_ed versions and comments.

XML Extension
Added the extension .xml to the initial associations (html highlighter), that are applied automatically when hpg_ed started for the first time.

Convert Spaces To TABS
Added new option under Editor/Tabs&Indention in configuration:
"Convert spaces to TABS on save". If option is switched on, a definable number of spaces will be converted to a real tab character. (It is also a great feature to reformat you source codes).

Fix - Long Lines
hpg_ed now displays a warning message when lines becomes longer than 1023 lines. The editor cannot display or edit those lines. If hpg_ed is invoked with a file that contains lines with more than 1023 characters it is rejected by hpg_ed and the standard lister is displayed instead.

User Reserved Folders
Added support for ENV-Variable "USERRESFOLDER". This variable can be set to comma-separated list of folders that are used to find the matching user reserved keyword list. The complete search oder is now (only if no full qualified path is given!):
   1st USERRESFOLDER
   2nd current folder
   3rd all parent folders (upto root) of current folder

Keyboard Binding Reference Table
Added a menu item to display all currently assigned keyboard bidings in a table. A temporary file is created and the default editor is invoked with it.

Document Property Dialog
Added a simple document properties dialog that displays some information about the current loaded document, its state, encoding and the used user reserved keyword file.

ANSI <-> OEM Converting Function
Added an ANSI to OEM and OEM to ANSI converting function. Use this if you want save a DOS file as Windows (ANSI) file or vice versa. Note: This is not the same than the WINDOWS<->Linux converting and there is not UNDO available.


V 0.5.10:
   - fix: The tab & indention settings are applied to the editor AFTER
	 a file was loaded and though the tabs are always converted to 3 spaces.
   - fix: minor fixes on configuration DLL forms' tab stops.
   - fix: The configuration dll is now searched in several places with the
	 follwing order:
	 1st: windows path or current directory of tcmd
	 2nd: directory where the hpg_ed is located in
	 3rd: the suggested place where the tcmd ini file is located in
	 Please take care that only one configuration dll 'hpg_ed_cfg.dll' is on
	 your system and old DLL's are not supported anymore!

V 0.5.9:
Changes:
   - fix: Changing background colours did not correctly work.
   - add: Added colour profiles to save colour sets and fast load some
	 predefined ones.
   - fix: CursorBeyondEOF did not work. Instead the KeepTrailingBlanks
	 options was used :-(
   - add: User reserved colours.
   - fix: Due to the user reserved colors old colour definitions in ini
	 files didn't work.

V 0.5.8:
Changes:
   - add: enhanced the find findnext function (F3, Ctrl-F).
	it supports now: backwards search and restarts search if term
	was not found at the start (or at the end in case of backwords
	search ;-).
   - fix: rejects binaries also if invoked via '4'. Currently this
	may unfortunatelly take some time :-(
   - enh: some graphical enhancements with gutter:
	added current line's indicator,
	gutter width is calculated at edit time (no flicker i hope) and is
	less width comsumpting :-)
   - add: in configuration you can now change default key bindings in a
	comprehensive dialog
   - add: Support for custom keywords, loaded asynchroniously from an external
	reference file(!)
	See description about Custom keywords in Readme.txt

V 0.5.7:
Changes:
   - fix: Small memory leak when reloaded a file (also when open via MRU)
   - add: Added MRU for the last 10 files opened with hpg_ed
   - add: Added MS Visual Studio like Bookmarks, CTRL-F2 Set/Unsets a bookmark
	 F2 jumps to the next bookmark regardingless of the bookmark's number
   - add: Bookmarks can be Set/Unset by simply clicking on the Gutter with the
	 left mouse button.
   - add: Added options Hide Gutter. If line numbers are switched off, the gutter
	 (and of course the bookmark indicators!) are hidden.

V 0.5.6:
Changes:
   - fix: Toolbar buttons do not reflect the real states for cut, copy, paste
   - enh: Removed the configuration from main application and moved it to the
	 new hpg_ed_cfg.dll. So the code is smaller and the plugin load faster into
	 memory.
   - add: Support now unix text files. hpg_ed detects now whether a file
	 is either ANSI oder UNIX style and saves the file in the detected
	 format. (Also added indicator in main lister window that displays unix in
	 case of unix files).
   - fix: Cursor Beyond EOF did not work, instead the SmartTabs value was used,
	 which lead to strange effects.
   - enh: Colour can be either one of the 16 palette entries or a custom color
	 which can be selected via color dialog.

V 0.5.5:
Changes:
   - add: Templates with auto completion. In edit mode use CTRL-J to pop up
	 a template list with pre-defined shortcuts that are assigned to portions
	 of code which will be inserted at the cursor location.
	 Example:
		in C++ code enter
		   fori
	  press CTRL-J and the fori is replaced with
		   for( int i = 0; i < | ; i++ ) {
			}
		Note the cursor is placed on the |
	 So this feature is quiet equal the one found in the Borland's Editors.
   - add: Added configuration page for the templates.
   - fix: 'N' and 'P' did not work if lister was invoked via F3 or Shift-F3.
	 Usually the next or previous selected file should be loaded, now its
	 fixed. Thanks to Christian Ghisler for the hint with keybd_event() :)

V 0.5.4:
Changes:
   - add: Syntax Highlighter Colours are now adjustable. Even the coulours used for
	 the selected block and the right margin :-) Very comprehensive new colour dialog.
   - add: right margin can now be switch on/off.
   - add: new line numberings without the flicker effects.
   - fix: flickering on resizing when lister was opened with hpg_ed before, made
	 listing in quick view panel mode very ugly.

V 0.5.3:
Changes:
   - chg: using TCMD's suggested directory to store its own ini file in (hpg_eg.ini)
   - fix: client region was not always correctly calculated
   - fix: configuration dialog's StayOnTop attribut forced the select font dialog
	 to be displayed behind the config dialog.
   - add: using 2 different fonts one for ASCII and another for ANSI display.
	 Note: you'll need to set up this in hpg_ed's own configuration dialog because
	 there is currently no API call implemented in TCMD's lister to get its information
	 directly.
   - chg: the configuration dialog is now plugged in the main lister form and
	 replaces the editor. This is a workaround of strange behaviors with topmost
	 dialogs etc.
   - chg: changed the configuration dialog and split up the properties into
	 different sections for easier configuration.
   - add: added sample to fonts section to test the two fonts immediately without
	 the need first to change back to the editor.

V 0.5.2:
Changes:
   - Added line/column display of current selection.
   - Added % display of current position.
   - Added support for jump to % via Listers percent menu item.
   - Added 'jump to line' function. Click on the line/columns display opens
	 the jump to line dialog.
   - Avoid the flicker when showing hpg_ed's form a little bit (moved alignment
	 of controls before showing form).
   - When pressing 'n' or 'p' in full lister view (F3) the next and previous.
	 selected (if any) files will not be loaded if not using the lister's menu.
	 Now you can press 'n' or 'p' two times (only in non-edit mode!).
	 The first keypress sets the focus on the lister's main window the second one
	 is processed by the lister itself instead of the hpg_ed's one.

Known Restrictions:
   - In Syntax highlighting mode the editor can only display up to 100000 lines
	 of source code. If changed to text or ini highlighting mode the file may
	 be larger.
   - If the file is very large the performance of the editor is decreased a lot.

V 0.5.1: 03/23/2003
Fixes:
   - Bug in INI Syntax highlighter (RALib 2.01).
	 If the line length exeeds 1025 characters an exception occured
	 (EOutOfRange, infinite exception loop).

V 0.5: 03/19/2003
Fixes:
   - PASCAL syntax highlighter was not shown in configuration dialog.
   - The states (enabled/disabled) of the toolbar buttons did not correctly
	 display the states of the current loaded file in editmode.
   - Corrected the version information, in 0.4 the files' version info was set
	 to 0.1.4 instead of 0.4(!).

Changes:
   - Added default font chose dialog.
   - Implemented a simple print function (does NOT use the Listers default
	 font nor character set, instead the default listers font will be used.
   - Added more options to configuration dialog, tab stops, smart tabs etc.
   - The internal configurations dialog's style is set to StayOnTop because
	 it was not possible to let it stay in the font of the lister window.

V 0.4: 03/16/2003
Changes:
	- localized version (added shortcuts)
	- added some options to the configurations dialog
	- auto edit mode
	- initially show/hide toolbar

V 0.3: 02/09/2003
Fixes:
	- when opening more than 1 lister form,
	  closing the second one forced exceptions
New:
   - added configuration dialog, available via 'Configure...'
   
V 0.1.x-0.2.x: January 2003
First version with syntax highlightings
