========================================================================

These are generic installation instructions for the CM-Super font package.

Below, we assume that your TeX system is compliant to the TDS
(TeX Directory Structure) standard. If it is not so, refer to
documentation of your TeX system for the proper locations of files of
various types.

To install the CM-Super font package in teTeX, fpTeX, TeX Live, MikTeX or
VTeX/Free systems:

1) Copy all Type 1 fonts (*.pfb files) to
   .../texmf/fonts/type1/public/cm-super/ directory.

2) [optional] Copy all AFM files to .../texmf/fonts/afm/public/cm-super/
   and gunzip them: gunzip *.afm.gz
   Note that the AFM files are not needed for using these fonts
   with pdf(la)tex or dvips, and their uncompressed size is huge!

3.1) [not for VTeX/Free]
   Copy all dvips/*.map and dvips/*.enc files and dvips/config.cm-super
   to .../texmf/dvips/cm-super/ directory.

   These dvips/*.map files are suited to be used by BOTH dvips and
   pdf(la)tex.

   If you are using dvipdfm, then copy all dvipdfm/*.map files to
   .../texmf/dvipdfm/config/ directory.

3.2) [for VTeX/Free]
   Copy all dvips/*.enc files to .../texmf/vtex/enc/ directory.
   Copy all vtex/*.ali files to .../texmf/vtex/config/ directory.

   You will need to generate all needed TFM files, because VTeX/Free can
   not generate them on the fly (TFM files for EC/TC, EC Concrete and
   EC Bright fonts are included into the VTeX/Free distribution).
   You can generate these files e.g. by processing your document by
   teTeX's latex. Put the TFM files to the curresponding subdirectories
   under .../texmf/fonts/tfm/.

3.3) If you wish to use the original CM germandbls (sharp s) shape,
   rather than the new EC one, change "germandbls" to "germandbls.alt"
   in cm-super-t1.enc.

4) Instruct your TeX (pdftex, vtex, etc.) or drivers (dvips, dvipdfm,
   etc.) to use these fonts. To accomplish this, do one of the following
   points which corresponds to your TeX system (if it is not listed here,
   please refer to the documentation).

4.1) [not for VTeX/Free] Instruct dvips and pdftex to use these fonts:

   a) [on teTeX, but not on TeX Live]
      edit the file .../texmf/dvips/config/updmap
      and add the following lines into the extra_modules section:

../cm-super/cm-super-t1.map
../cm-super/cm-super-ts1.map
../cm-super/cm-super-t2a.map
../cm-super/cm-super-t2b.map
../cm-super/cm-super-t2c.map
../cm-super/cm-super-x2.map

   b) run the updmap script.

4.2) If your TeX system does not have tools like updmap for
   maintaining global MAP files (e.g. MikTeX), you can instead
   configure each program which uses the Type 1 fonts:

   a) edit the file .../texmf/dvips/config/config.ps and add the
   following lines:

p +cm-super-t1.map
p +cm-super-ts1.map
p +cm-super-t2a.map
p +cm-super-t2b.map
p +cm-super-t2c.map
p +cm-super-x2.map

   Alternatively, run dvips with the option "-Pcm-super".

   b) edit the file .../texmf/pdftex/config/pdftex.cfg and add the
   following lines:

map +cm-super-t1.map
map +cm-super-ts1.map
map +cm-super-t2a.map
map +cm-super-t2b.map
map +cm-super-t2c.map
map +cm-super-x2.map

   c) edit the file .../texmf/dvipdfm/config/config and add the
   following lines:

f cm-super-t1.map
f cm-super-ts1.map
f cm-super-t2a.map
f cm-super-t2b.map
f cm-super-t2c.map
f cm-super-x2.map

4.3) [for VTeX/Free only] Edit the files .../texmf/vtex/config/ps.fm and
   .../texmf/vtex/config/pdf.fm, and add the following lines into the
   TYPE1 section:

cm-super.ali
cm-super-t1.ali
cm-super-ts1.ali
cm-super-t2a.ali
cm-super-t2b.ali
cm-super-t2c.ali
cm-super-x2.ali

   (at the beginning of that section, if you wish to use CM-Super
   fonts even for EC/TC fonts which are now bundled with VTeX/Free)

5) [not for VTeX/Free] Update the filename search database:
   run "mktexlsr" on teTeX, TeX Live, or fpTeX;
   run "initexmf.exe -u" on MikTeX (or do the same via a menu item)

6) [optional, for advanced users]
   If you wish to not download CM-Super fonts into your PS or PDF
   files (to make them smaller), you may want to change the dvips
   *.map files by removing "<" characters before *.pfb file names,
   i.e. change lines like

ecrm1000 SFRM1000 "T1Encoding ReEncodeFont" <cm-super-t1.enc <sfrm1000.pfb

   to:

ecrm1000 SFRM1000 "T1Encoding ReEncodeFont" <cm-super-t1.enc sfrm1000.pfb

   [this should be done after step 3)]
   If you have Perl, you can do this by running the command:

perl -p -i.orig -e 's/<([a-z0-9]+\.pfb)$/$1/' cm-super-*.map

   You also need to make the CM-Super fonts visible in Ghostscript.
   To do this, install the file dvips/cm-super.GS into the Ghostscript's
   "lib" directory, and add the following line to the file "Fontmap":

(cm-super.GS) .runlibfile

   and make sure that the CM-Super *.pfb font files are present in the
   Ghostscript search path (see the "Font lookup" section in Use.htm
   in Ghostscript distribution).

   Note that if you distribute such PS or PDF files, you must make
   sure that the recipient has the CM-Super fonts installed and
   visible to Ghostscript or Acrobat Reader; otherwise, you should
   embed fonts into the PS or PDF documents (which is used by default).

7) You can install the CM-Super fonts as regular Windows fonts, if you
   wish to use them in non-TeX applications (e.g. packages for
   preparation of graphics which are to be included into your TeX
   documents, or even word processors, etc.)

   You will need Adobe Type Manager (either a regular version, or the
   Lite version, which is available for free from the Adobe web site).

   To do this, you will need to uncompress the AFM files provided with
   this distribution (e.g. using WinZip).

   Place all corresponding PFB, AFM, and INF files which you need to
   install into the same directory, and feed it to ATM.
