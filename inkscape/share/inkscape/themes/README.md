# About Inkscape Themes

Inkscape maintains and ships a set of custom GTK3 themes, that were optimized to work well with the program.

They're kept in a git repository: https://gitlab.com/inkscape/themes/

Everybody is encouraged to edit these themes and improve them. You can use tools such as the GTK Inspector (video link below) to improve the way Inkscape looks for you and other users.

If you have questions feel free to drop by in the Inkscape UX team's chat: https://chat.inkscape.org/channel/team_ux

# Upstream Policy

When modifying themes you should consider if the theme changes you are applying are specific to Inkscape or are generic to any Gtk application. Many themes will have upstreams (parent projects) where you generic improvements should be sent in addition to being committed here. This helps maintain a wider community of theme developers where possible.

There is a way to get the inspector to work on windows and macOS, but these links need to be added here by their respective people.

Thanks for your help making Inkscape look better!
