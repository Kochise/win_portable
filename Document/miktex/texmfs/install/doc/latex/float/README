  The float package
  =================

This package improves the interface for defining floating objects such
as figures and tables in LaTeX.  It adds the notion of a `float style'
that governs appearance of floats.  New kinds of floats may be defined
using a \newfloat command analogous to \newtheorem.  This style option
also incorporates the functionality of David Carlisle's style option
`here', giving floating environments a [H] option which means `PUT IT
HERE' (as opposed to the standard [h] option which means `You may put
it here if you like').

Run `float.ins' through LaTeX to produce float.sty from float.dtx.
Run `float.dtx' through LaTeX to produce the documentation.
