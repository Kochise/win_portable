README for breakurl, version 1.40 (2013/04/10)


INTRODUCTION
============

The breakurl is an extension to hyperref package that allows line-breakable
\url-like links when compiling via latex + dvips + ps2pdf.


DESCRIPTION
===========

This package provides a command much like hyperref's \url that typesets a URL
using a typewriter-like font.  However, if the dvips driver is being used, the
original \url doesn't allow line breaks in the middle of the created link: the
link comes in one atomic piece.  This package allows such line breaks in the
generated links.

Note that this package is intended only for those using the dvips driver.
Users of the pdflatex driver already have this feature.


INSTALLATION
============

Eventually breakurl may be pre-configured on your system. These instructions
are relevant only if your LaTeX system complains about missing `breakurl.sty'.

If you use MiKTeX, the utility "MiKTeX Package Manager" (Start menu > Programs
> MiKTeX > Browse Packages or MiKTeX Package Manager) is your friend. Just
select `breakurl' and click on Task > Install.

Some Linux systems provide an easy way to install breakurl. As far as I know,
recent Debian and Ubuntu distros provide the "texlive-latex-extra" system
package in the default repository.

If you need to do a manual installation (eventually needed under Unix-like
systems), following instructions may come in handy:

a) Download the package files from CTAN or the TUG server.

b) Generate the `breakurl.sty' file:

     latex breakurl.ins

c) Install the file `breakurl.sty' into your TDS tree:

     mkdir [prefix]/texmf/tex/latex/breakurl
     cp breakurl.sty [prefix]/texmf/tex/latex/breakurl/

   where `[prefix]' is the prefix of your TDS tree.

d) Update the databases if necessary, eg. for teTeX:

     mktexlsr [prefix]/texmf


DOCUMENTATION
=============

Please see the breakurl.pdf for a more comprehensive description of the
package, its options, issues, etc. Or generate a dvi version using the
following:

     latex breakurl.dtx
