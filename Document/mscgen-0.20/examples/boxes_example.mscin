   // The following three boxes will be aligned due to the use
   // of "comma" to separate them (instead of semi-colon).

   A box A [label="box"],   // Box (with "square corners") placed upon line "A"
   B rbox B [label="rbox"], // Box (with "round corners") upon the line "B"
   C abox C [label="abox"], // Box (with "<>-sides") upon the line "C"

        //  - similar to an empty line in a text document.
