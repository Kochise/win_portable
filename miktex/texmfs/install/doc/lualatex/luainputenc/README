                        The luainputenc LaTeX2e package


luainputenc is an adaptation of inputenc for LuaTeX, as the old inputenc does
not work (at all) with the LuaTeX engine. It is used only for compatibility
with old documents. New documents should be encoded in UTF-8 and use Unicode
fonts (eg with a recent verion of the fontspec package).

This package automatically calls the old inputenc when running with pdfTeX, and
xetex-inputenc when running XeTeX, so you can safely use it with all your
documents.

This package is developed on <http://github.com/mpg/luainputenc>, see the 'NEWS'
file for version history.
