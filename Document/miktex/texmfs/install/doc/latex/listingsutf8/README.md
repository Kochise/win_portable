# listingsutf8

listingsutf8 package for LaTeX


Package listings does not support files with multi-byte
encodings such as UTF-8. In case of \lstinputlisting a simple
workaround is possible if an one-byte encoding exists that the file
can be converted to. Also eTeX and pdfTeX regardless of its mode
are required.
