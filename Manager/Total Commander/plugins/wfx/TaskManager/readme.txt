Procfs - plugin for Windows Commander 5.5 and newer.
version 2.0

This plugin allows to view/edit/kill processes that are running currently on the system.
This plugin can:
  1. View list of processes.
  2. Kill ANY process (including system).
     NOTE: You can kill system process only if you have admin status.
     WARNING: If you are killing system process windows may not work properly.
  3. View and save additional information;
  4. View windows created by selected process.
  5. Change priority class.

In Total Commander's panel you can see:
  1. Process module name.
  2. Process Handle.
  3. Memory used by process (only win NT-XP);
  4. Time when process begin (only win NT-XP);
  5. Information about swap file and currently used RAM (use CTRL+R to view it)

Main plugin window.
  You will see this window if you will press ENTER on process.
  In a tree you will see list of windows that belongs to selected process.
  If tree item name is bold then window is visible.
  Also you can change some extended options on selected window:
    1. Enable/disable window
    2. Show/hide window
    3. Set window always on top
    4. Change alfablend value (win 2000-XP)
    4. Change caption, size and position of the window

When you will work with this plugin I'm recommending:
  1. Change columns width.
  2. Change sort type to unsorted (show/unsorted).
  3. Disable word-wrap in the Lister.

Main commands:
  F3, F4 - Get information (as view/edit file) about selected process.
  ENTER - view windows list (at this window you can change priority class).
  ALT-ENTER - view standard file-properties window (not work for some system
process, because system hides full file name).
  DEL, F8 - kill selected process.
  CTRL-R - refresh process list.
  note: if you press CTRL-R you can see information about used memory.



How to install the plugin in Windows Commander:
  1. Unzip the archive to an empty directory
  2. Choose Configuration -> Options -> Operation -> FS-Plugins
  3. Click "Add"
  4. Go to the directory, where you unzip archive, and choose procfs.wfx
  5. Click OK. You can now access the plugin in "Network Neighborhood"

Note:
  Now all plugin's functions are supported at Windows 9x/NT/2000/XP.
