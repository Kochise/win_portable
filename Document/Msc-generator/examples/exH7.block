##Arrow routing distance
##arrow routing distance
##You can specify 'distance' for an arrow to say (in pixels) how far it shall go around other blocks. You can also specify a distance just for one or more block using 'distance=A+B@10' for example. In this case the distance is set only for these blocks. You can apply this attribute several times.
use margin=30, imargin=10;
box a: Apple;
box b: Pear;
box c: Orange;
a->c: arrow label [distance=20, via=b@top];
