This is the file CJKutf8.txt of the CJK macro package ver. 4.8.4
(18-Apr-2015).

CJKutf8.sty
-----------

This package merges base LaTeX's and CJK's UTF-8 support. If a Unicode
character (within a CJK environment) corresponds to a glyph from the
selected LaTeX font encoding, use it, otherwise it is taken from the
selected CJK unicode font.

Usage:

  \usepackage[<font encoding>]{CJKutf8}

  The <font encoding> value is directly passed to the `fontenc' package.
  Besides `fontenc', CJKutf8.sty also loads the CJK package with the
  `encapsulated' option so that you can use UTF-8 outside of the CJK
  environment also.

  Note that only font encodings with a corresponding DFU file actually
  have Unicode definitions (for example, `t1enc.dfu').

  Only use UTF-8 encoding for the CJK environment! Other encodings
  don't give an error but might replace some CJK characters with glyphs
  from the selected LaTeX encoding.

If pdftex is used, ToUnicode cmaps are automatically generated (for C70
encoding); use it in combination with Vladimir Volovich's `cmap' package.

If CJKutf8.sty is used together with the `unicode' option of the hyperref
package, pdftex automatically produces correct Unicode bookmarks.

Both ToUnicode cmaps and Unicode bookmarks support characters greater than
U+FFFF.

Please read section `Possible errors' in CJK.txt regarding the Byte Order
Mark (BOM) -- this should always be removed.
