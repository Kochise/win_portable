NAME
       bg5conv  - convert a TeX document in Big 5 encoding into `preprocessed'
       form.

SYNOPSIS
       bg5conv < infile > outfile

DESCRIPTION
       Big 5 encoding for traditional Chinese uses the characters {, }, and  \
       which have special meanings in TeX documents.

       After  processing  a  LaTeX 2e document which contains Big 5 characters
       with bg5conv you need not care about these special characters.

       This filter is part of the CJK macro package for LaTeX 2e.
