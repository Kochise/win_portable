The package aims to give a consistent interface to including the file types that are understood in your output, by use of ‘printer drivers’ (now known, simply, as ‘drivers’). The distribution of the package contains several drivers, but others (for example, pdfTeX) are distributed separately. The package also offers several means of manipulating graphics in the course of inserting them into a document (for example, rotation and scaling). For extended documentation see epslatex. The package is part of the graphics bundle, which is one of the collections in the LaTeX ‘required’ set of packages.</TPM:Description><TPM:RunFiles size="105234">texmf\tex\latex\graphics\color.sty texmf\tex\latex\graphics\dvipdf.def texmf\tex\latex\graphics\dvipsnam.def texmf\tex\latex\graphics\dvipsone.def texmf\tex\latex\graphics\dviwin.def texmf\tex\latex\graphics\emtex.def texmf\tex\latex\graphics\epsfig.sty texmf\tex\latex\graphics\graphics-2017-06-25.sty texmf\tex\latex\graphics\graphics.sty texmf\tex\latex\graphics\graphicx.sty texmf\tex\latex\graphics\keyval.sty texmf\tex\latex\graphics\lscape.sty texmf\tex\latex\graphics\pctex32.def texmf\tex\latex\graphics\pctexhp.def texmf\tex\latex\graphics\pctexps.def texmf\tex\latex\graphics\pctexwin.def texmf\tex\latex\graphics\rotating.sty texmf\tex\latex\graphics\tcidvi.def texmf\tex\latex\graphics\trig.sty texmf\tex\latex\graphics\truetex.def</TPM:RunFiles><TPM:TimePackaged>1639602682</TPM:TimePackaged><TPM:MD5>145ebf7ae58eaec673bccbf67870589b</TPM:MD5><TPM:CTAN path="/macros/latex/required/graphics"/><TPM:Copyright owner="David Carlisle, Sebastian Rahtz" year="1994"/><TPM:License type="lppl1.3c"/></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
