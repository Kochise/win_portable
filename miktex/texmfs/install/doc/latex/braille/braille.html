<h2><a name="Sec1">1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction</a></h2>
<p>This package allows user to produce Braille documents on
paper for the blind without knowing Braille which can take years to
learn.  Essentially, Python scripts <b>grade1.py</b> and
<b>grade2.py</b> convert ordinary text to grade 1 and 2 braille tags;
then, LaTeX2e package <b>braille.sty</b> takes the tags and prints out
corresponding braille symbols.  
<h2><a name="Sec2">2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;braille.sty</a></h2>
LaTeX2e package <b>braille.sty</b> defines macros, commands,
and fonts to typeset 6-dot braille symbols.  Both Grade 1 and 2
Braille are supported.  All 189 grade 2 contractions are defined;
however, some puctuation symbols are missing simply because I couldn't
find them.  List of TeX macros and braille symbols can be found in
<b>summary.tex</b> and <b>summary.pdf</b>.  
The full usage is 
<xmp>\usepackage[puttinydots,useemptybox]{braille}</xmp>
where <tt>puttinydots</tt> puts <tt>{\tiny.}</tt> at all dot positions
for visual check, and <tt>useemptybox</tt> uses empty braille box
instead of <tt>\hskip</tt>.  In addition, 4 macros are available to
the user:
<ul>
<li><tt>\braillebox{}</tt> -- LaTeX picture box used as braille font
<li><tt>\brailleunit</tt> -- <tt>\unitlength</tt> for <tt>\braillebox{}</tt>
<li><tt>\brailledot{}</tt> -- actual dot printed in <tt>\braillebox{}</tt>
<li><tt>\braille{}</tt> -- main user command 
</ul>  
The command <tt>\braille{}</tt> is used to print braille
"text" or tags which are made up of
<ul>
<li> single characters, such as <tt>a</tt>, <tt>b</tt>, <tt>1</tt>,
<tt>?</tt>, <tt>!</tt>
<li> string enclosed in {}, such as <tt>{this}</tt>, <tt>{every}</tt>,
<tt>{his}</tt>, <tt>{''}</tt>
</ul>
For example, given input text of <tt>I {like} {com}put{er}</tt>, it
will print braille symbols for <i>I</i>, <i>like</i>, <i>com</i>,
<i>p</i>, <i>u</i>, <i>t</i>, <i>er</i>, along with the 2 spaces.  
Therefore, you can type braille paragraph just as you would
type normal text paragraph.  To print single character, type that
character.  To print multi-character contraction, type that string
enclosed in {}.  Because of the way TeX processes macro arguments, if
the argument is more than one line, then put at least one space after
newline (<tt>\n</tt>).  Spaces at the end of line, and tabs and
newlines everywhere are ignored; but, multiple spaces in between words
collapse to single space.  
<p>For example, if you want to insult someone,
<pre>
\usepackage{braille}
\braille{May you live in an interesting time.}
</pre>
will print grade 1 braille, 
<p> <img height="72" width="636" src="braillegif1.gif">
<p>and 
<pre>\braille{May {you} live {in} an {in}t{er}e{st}{ing} {time}.}</pre>
will print grade 2 braille, 
<p> <img height="72" width="534" src="braillegif2.gif">
<p>Now, if you can read and write Braille, then you can type
the braille tags manually.  But, since my knowledge of Braille is
limited and recent, I wrote Python scripts to generate the braille
tags automatically.  
<h2><a name="Sec3">3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;grade1.py, grade2.py</a></h2>
<p>Grade 1 Braille is simple character-by-character
translation of text.  Most braille tags are the same as text
characters.  However, some puctuation markups, such as double and
single quotations, are made up of multi-character string which must be
enclosed in {} in order to be understood by LaTeX.  
<p>Grade 2 Braille defines translation of 189 common strings
and where they can be used.  Since braille tags here are the same
multi-character string as the text, they must be enclosed in {}.  The
complexity of grade 2 is not so much in the replacement of strings,
words, or part of words, but it is in figuring out whether the
replacement can take place.  The rules for applying grade 2
contractions are complicated with many exceptions; sometimes you can
replace it, sometimes you can't.  
<p>The Python scripts <b>grade1.py</b> and <b>grade2.py</b>
take ordinary text and generate grade 1 and 2 braille tags as defined
by <b>braille.sty</b>.  Since the output is returned all in one line,
the scripts are originally designed to be used from text editor which
can format a long line into multi-line paragraph.  The command line
usages are
<dl>
<dd>python grade1.py &lt; <i>text_file</i> &gt; <i>tag_file</i>
<dd>python grade2.py &lt; <i>text_file</i> &gt; <i>tag_file</i>
</dl>
or their usage as python module are
<dl>
<dd><i>string</i> = grade1.convert(<i>string</i>)
<dd><i>string</i> = grade2.convert(<i>string</i>)
</dl>
