zref packages for LaTeX


Package zref tries to get rid of the restriction
in LaTeX's reference system that only two properties are
supported. The package implements an extensible referencing
system, where properties are handled in a more flexible way.
It offers an interface for macro programmers for the access
to the system and some applications that uses the new
reference scheme.
