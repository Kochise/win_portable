The Chinese Encoding Framework (CEF)
------------------------------------

Christian Wittern (http://www.kanji.zinbun.kyoto-u.ac.jp/~wittern/),
developed CEF, the Chinese Encoding Framework. It is a method to embed CJK
characters in seldom used encodings (which usually no editor provides) in
ordinary text (which may be of any encoding). This is done by using SGML
(Standardized Generalized Markup Language) macros of the form

    &xx-yyzz; 

To input these characters Wittern wrote KanjiBase for Windows, essentially a
character data base search engine written in Visual Basic. This application
is rather obsolete today.


`xx' in the SGML macro can have the following values:

    C0  Big 5 encoded characters
    C1  characters from CNS plane 1
    ...
    C7  characters from CNS plane 7
    CX  characters from a reserved encoding defined by IRIZ
    CY  private encoding
    U   Unicode characters

`yy' and `zz' are the first and second byte in hexadecimal notation.
For C0-C7, CX, and CY the 7bit notation must be used (GL).

Examples:

    &C0-A4CD;
    &C4-275F;
    &U-DCFF;


TeX can't process these macros directly. They must be converted with one of
the following preprocessors:

    cefconv         standard converter (also for use with cjk-enc.el)
    cef5conv        also converts Big 5 characters to preprocessed form
    cefsconv        also converts SJIS characters to preprocessed form

ceflatex.bat is a simple batch file for DOS to show how to use the converter
(cef5ltx.bat and cefsltx.bat are its siblings---for Unix, the scripts are
called ceflatex, cef5latex, and cefslatex, respectively).

Say

    ceflatex mytext[.tex]

to get mytext.tex processed. All CEF macros must be inside of a CJK (or
CJK*) environment.

To input CEF characters without preprocessing you can use the \CJKchar
macro. Here an example:

    \CJKchar[CNS4]{"27}{"5F}

Note: The OS/2 script files ceflatex.cmd, etc., need REXX which you probably
      have to install first.


Availability
------------

The file

  http://iriz.hanazono.ac.jp/pdf/eb4/x-level_kanjibase_codes.pdf

contains a list of X level CJK characters defined by IRIZ. It isn't very
useful because the document is a just a scan of some pages of the magazine
`The Electronic Bodhidharma', published by the International Research
Institute for Zen Buddhism (IRIZ) at the Hanazono University in Kyoto, Japan
(iriz.hanazono.ac.jp). Note that this institute still publishes many
Buddhist documents using CEF (there it is called `KanjiBase').

More data about CEF and KanjiBase can be found at Christian Wittern's old
