Txfonts supplies virtual text roman fonts using Adobe Times (or 
URW NimbusRomNo9L) with some modified and additional text symbols in 
the OT1, T1, and TS1 encodings; maths alphabets using Times/URW Nimbus; 
maths fonts providing all the symbols of the Computer Modern and AMS 
fonts, including all the Greek capital letters from CMR; and additional 
maths fonts of various other symbols.

The set is complemented by a sans-serif set of text fonts, based on 
Helvetica/NimbusSanL, and a monospace set.

All the fonts are in Type 1 format (AFM and PFB files), and are supported 
by TeX metrics (VF and TFM files) and macros for use with LaTeX.
