This is the README file for `bibtopic', a LaTeX package for including
several bibliographies in a document.  These bibliographies might be
considered to cover different topics (hence the name) or bibliographic
material (e.g., primary and secondary literature) and the like.

You'll have to create a separate .bib file for each of these
bibliographies.

If you want to have per-chapter bibliographies in a document, have
a look at the packages `bibunits' or `chapterbib' instead.

The package is a modified version of Pierre Basso's `bibtopics.sty'
(ftp://ftp.univ-rennes1.fr/pub/gut/contrib/bibtopics/); it is
distibuted under the GNU General Public License (see bibtopic.ins for
details).

To produce style + documentation, you need to download the files
`bibtopic.ins' and `bibtopic.dtx'. Run LaTeX on bibtopic.ins and
follow the instructions.

Happy TeXing!
