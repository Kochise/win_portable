The CHANGEPAGE and CHNGPAGE packages
================

Provides commands to change the page layout in the middle of a document,
and to robustly check for typesetting on odd or even pages.

The changepage package is an extraction of code from the memoir class.
It is a functionally-equivalent replacement for chngpage package.
Because chngpage is not compatible with memoir, its use is now deprecated.
