%
% \part{Discussion}
%
% \section{Attributions}
%
% FIX: maybe \cs\attrib when not in a block environment should do this, with
% appropriate hooks added, etc.: use the blkcntrl hooks. and Pre stuff.
% \begin{codeexample}
%  \def\attrib [1] {%
%    (\begingroup
%    \attribcitations
%    #1%
%    \endgroup
%    )%
%  }
% \end{codeexample}
% Here's an example of the kind that inspires the question: \code{({\attribcitations
% \citework{3}{unnam}, and see page~\pageref{q:aporia}})}.  This way
% \cs\attribcitations and \cs\normalcitations could still be defined only
% within \cs\attrib, which seems the most sensible.
%
% \DescribeMacro\attrib
%   I wrote \cs\attrib in order to have an abstract way to attribute the source
%   of quotations of prose or verse in an academic style.  The formatting is
%   that recommended by the \manual, except that attributions of block
%   quotations of prose are given flush right, to allow the reader to locate a
%   quotation more quickly when returning to the text.
%
%   Use \cs\attrib\marg{attribution} at the end of any block of text,
%   such as the \env{quote}, \env{quotation}, \env{verse}, and \env{dialogue}
%   environments (the last is defined in the \package{dialogue} package, also
%   part of the \Frankenstein bundle).
%
%   For \env{verse}, you ought to use either a blank line or a final \cs{\\}
%   before your attribution.  For \env{quote}, \env{quotation}, and
%   \env{dialgoue}, don't leave a blank line.
%
%   \cs\attrib will place the attribution flush right to the margins of the
%   block.  If there is enough room on the last line, the attribution will be
%   given on the last line, otherwise it moves down to a line of its own.
%
%   You can put pretty much anything as the text of the attribution, including
%   citations and footnotes.  
%
%   For those using the \package{achicago} and \package{abbrevs} packages (also
%   in the \Frankenstein bundle), \cs\citework works very well.  If you're
%   using regular \cs\cite or another package, I recommend using the FIX hook
%   below to remove the usual parens or braces around citations that occur
%   within the \cs\attrib argument.  It makes more sense to me that way.
% 
% \DescribeMacro\normalcitations
%   If parens are normally around citations, they are removed when citations
%   occur within attributions.  The idea is that you can simply write
%   \code{\attrib{\cite{key}}} and what normally surrounds the citation will be
%   replaced with \cs\PreTrib and \cs\PostTrib (which of course could be the
%   same thing, but doing it this way allows attributions to contain things
%   \emph{other} than just a citation and still everything will look right).
%
%   Whenever within an attribution you want the normal behavior of citations
%   back, write \cs\normalcitations.  \cs\normalcitations is automatically used
%   within footnotes within attributions; it's used in the \package{epigraph}
%   package; and occasionally a user will want to invoke it, when the
%   attribution is unusual.  I find that most attributions are either just a
%   citation, or they do not have a citation at all.  Sometimes I've wanted an
%   attribution consisting of a citation plus some other text, for which cases
%   I provided \cs\normalcitations as a user command.
%
%   \todo{Right now the only time there is any concept of ``normal'' or
%   altered behavior of \cs\cite commands is with the \package{achicago}
%   package.  I should make it so that \cs\attrib by default leaves off braces,
%   brackets, etc, around citations, for the standard definition of \cs\cite also.}
%
% \DescribeMacro\attribcitations
%
%   FIX: dox, example.
%
% \section{Examples}
%   Following are several examples that use \cs\attrib.  They should be
%   self-explanatory.
%
% \begin{bothexample}
%   \begin{quotation}
%     [My plays] deal with distress.  Some people object to this in my writing.
%
%     At a party an English intellectual---so called---asked me why I write always
%     about distress.  As if it were perverse to do so!  He wanted to know if my
%     father had beaten me or my mother had run away from home to give me an
%     unhappy childhood.  I told him no, that I had had a very happy childhood.
%     Then he thought me more perverse than ever.  I left the party as soon as
%     possible and got into a taxi.  On the glass partition between me and the
%     driver were three signs: one asked for help for the blind, another help for
%     orphans, and the third for relief for the war refugees.  One does not have to
%     look for distress.  It is screaming at you even in the taxis of London.

%     And what I should be, all but less then he \\
%     Whom Thunder hath made greater?  Here at least \\
%     We shall be free; th' Almighty hath not built \\
%     Here for his envy, will not drive us hence: \\
%     Here we may reign secure, and in my choyce \\

%             \cite{milton:riverside:paralost}}
%   \end{verse}
% \end{bothexample}
%
% You can have a footnote inside the attribution.  The boxed example below is
% meant to approximate a whole page (that is, the footnote appears at the
% bottom of the page, not directly underneath the quotation).
% \begin{bothexample}
%   \begin{verse}
%     Jacke boy, ho boy newes,\\
%     \quad the cat is in the well,\\
%     let us ring now for her Knell,\\
%     \quad ding dong ding dong Bell.
%
%     \attrib{\cite[149]{opie:nursery}\footnote {%
%   Perhaps more familiar is the nursery rhyme that begins ``Ding,
%   dong, bell, / Pussy's in the well,'' which Opie and Opie also cite.  It does
%   not seem clear in that rhyme, however, without contextual knowledge, that the
%   cat has died and the bell rings its knell.}}
%   \end{verse}
% \end{bothexample}
%
% Here is a quotation from \citeNP{beckett:watt}:
% \begin{bothexample}
%   \newwork\watt{Watt}
%   \begin{quote}
%     One day Watt, coming out from behind a bush, almost ran into Mr~Knott,
%     which for an instant troubled Watt greatly, for he had not quite finished
%     adjusting his dress.  But he need not have been troubled.  For Mr~Knott's
%     hands were behind his back, and his head bowed down, towards the ground.
%     Then Watt in his turn looking down at first saw nothing but the short green
%     grass, but when he had looked a little longer he saw a little blue flower
%     and close by a fat worm burrowing into the earth.  So this was what had
%     attracted Mr~Knott's attention, perhaps.  So there for a short time they
%     stood together, the master and the servant, the bowed heads almost touching
%     \lips, until the worm was gone and only the flower remained.  One day the
%     flower would be gone and only the worm remain, but on this particular day
%     it was the flower that remained, and the worm that went.  And then Watt,
%     looking up, saw that Mr~Knott's eyes were closed, and heard his breathing,
%     soft and shallow, like the breathing of a child asleep.
%     \attrib{\citework{145--46}{watt}}
%   \end{quote}
% \end{bothexample}
%
% Finally, here's a very simple example from the same book.  When the context
% is clear, you might just want page numbers in the attribution.
% \begin{bothexample}
%   \begin{quote}
%     For Watt now found himself in the midst of things which, if they
%     consented to be named, did so as it were with reluctance.\lips Looking at
%     a pot, for example, \lips it was in vain that Watt said, Pot, pot.  Well,
%     perhaps not quite in vain, but very nearly. \lips It resembled a pot, it
%     was almost a pot, but it was not a pot of which one could say, Pot, pot,
%     and be comforted.  It was in vain that it answered, with unexceptionable
%     adequacy, all the purposes, and performed all the offices, of a pot, it
%     was not a pot.  And it was just this hairbreadth departure from the
%     nature of a true pot that so excruciated Watt\lips.  For he could always
%     hope, of a thing of which he had never known the name, that he would
%     learn the name, some day, and so be tranquillized.
%
%     \attrib{81--82}
%   \end{quote}
% \end{bothexample}
%
% Here's an example of use with the \env{dialogue} environment.  Not much
% different than the others, but the quotes are nice, and I'll demonstrate a
% use of \cs\normalcitations.  \refer{b}'s speeches are interspersed through
% the play with \refer{a}'s and \refer{c}'s, but it's interesting to read them
% consecutively.

%
% \section{Programmer's Interface}
%
% You might want to use \cs\attrib as part of some other command you define.
% For example, I wrote a command for epigraphs,
% \cs\epigraph\marg{text}{attribution}, which used \cs\attrib internally.  For
% this type of thing, and also in general I suppose, you might want to change
% the behavior of \cs\attrib.
%
% \DescribeMacro\AttribMinSkip
%   \cs\AttribMinSkip is a length, the minimum amount of horizontal space that
%   must come after any previous text and before the attribution.  The default
%   value is \code{2em}.
%
% \DescribeMacro\PreTrib
% \DescribeMacro\PostTrib
%   When you write \cs\attrib{attribution}, \cs\PreTrib will immediately
%   precede \meta{attribution} and \cs\PostTrib will immediately follow it.
%   Notice how the attributions in the examples above were in parentheses, but
%   we didn't have to write them.  The default value of \cs\PreTrib is a left
%   parenthesis and the default value of \cs\PostTrib is a right parenthesis.
%   \cs\PreTrib and \meta{attribution} are executed inside a group that doesn't
%   include \PostTrib, and \cs\PostTrib is executed in a group all by itself,
%   like this:  \code{{\PreTrib\relax#1}{\PostTrib}}.  Honestly I can't tell
%   you right now why it's done this way, but I'm sure I have some good reason
%   for it!
%
% \DescribeMacro\AttribInit
%   \cs\AttribInit is an hook, empty by default, that gets executed after some
%   standard setup but before the core of the \cs\attrib macro.  It is executed
%   within a group that includes \cs\PreTrib, \meta{attribution}, and
%   \cs\PostTrib, so perhaps it is appropriate for a font style change or
%   something (I haven't made use of it myself).
