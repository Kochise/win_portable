# kvsetkeys

kvsetkeys package for LaTeX


Package kvsetkeys provides kvsetkeys, a variant
of package keyval's \cs{setkeys}. It allows to specify
a handler that deals with unknown options. Active commas and equal
signs may be used (e.g. see babel's shorthands) and
only one level of curly braces is removed from the values.
