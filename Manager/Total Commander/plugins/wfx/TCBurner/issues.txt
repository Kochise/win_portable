[] On some burning devices the plugin may fail to detect the available burning
   speeds, in that case you can only burn at max. speed.

[] On some burning devices and some media types, the plugin may fail to detect
   drive/media parameters (media status, media type, media free/used space,
   session count, session sizes) correctly. In most cases this is due to 
   erroneous device firmware or incompatibilities.
   
   If such misdetection prevents you from burning (e.g. rewritable detected as
   non-rewritable), you can choose to skip media checks in the config dialog.

[] There is an issue with burning certain bootable ISO images. It can happen
   that the plugin seems to write more data to the CD than the image actually
   contains, and the resulting CD is not usable. This is an issue with the
   FoxBurner SDK and it is being worked on.
