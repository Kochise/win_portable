FONTLOG for the MarVoSym font with TeX support

This file provides detailed information on the MarVoSym font with TeX support. This information should be distributed along with the fonts and any derivative works.

This file has been created for the MarVoSym font with TeX support. The original font MarVoSym at marvosym.com lacks a FONTLOG as recommended by the SIL Open Font Licence.


Basic Font Information

MarVoSym is Martin Vogel's Symbols font.  It contains many useful
symbols, especially for office and civil engineering purposes.

This marvosym package contains additional support files for TeX.


Note: This is not a Unicode-compliant font. Characters that could have been
mapped to Unicode slots (like Zodiac) are all in ASCII range or under 256.

Documentation is included in package that can be downloaded from
    http://ctan.org/pkg/marvosym

ChangeLog

2012-04-06 (Heiko Oberdiek, Mojca Miklavec) MarVoSym font with TeX support Version 2.2a
- Added PDF with glyph tables (reproduction of Martin's PDF document in TeX).
- Replaced \EMail by \Email and \CheckedBox by \Checkedbox
  due to name clashes with other LaTeX packages.

2011-08-15 (Mojca Miklavec) MarVoSym font with TeX support Version 2.2
- Fixed licence of TeX support files. Original font is licenced under OFL,
  which prohibits GPL licence. Reorganized documentation, added OFL licence
  texts and this FONTLOG.txt which is sadly missing in original font.
  Thanks to Karl Berry for many useful suggestions and impromevents.
- Added original TTF font.
- Updated to font version 3.10 (2008-09-01).
- Recreated Type 1 font files with some incompatible changes in font metrics,
  some glyphs removed and some newly introduced ones. Created TDS directory
  structure and made LaTeX macros 100 % compatible with original names.
  Old LaTeX names were kept as synonyms.
- AFM file now contains proper glyph names instead of names of
  ASCII characters on those slots.
- Characters `A' and `p' (positions 0xF0 and 0xF1) are no longer present,
  as they are not in the original font.
- Some high school logos were removed or replaced.

2008-09-01 (Martin Vogel) MarVoSym font Version 3.10
- note: documentation claims the release date to be 2008-09-01,
  while font file refers to 2007-11-04
- (changelog unknown; it can only be reconstructed from comparison of Thomas'
  latest pfb and new ttf; maybe somebody will do that comparison one day)
