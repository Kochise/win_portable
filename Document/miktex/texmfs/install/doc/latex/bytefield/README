Description
-----------

The bytefield package helps the user create illustrations for network
protocol specifications and anything else that utilizes fields of
data.  These illustrations show how the bits and bytes are laid out in
a packet, register, or memory.


Building bytefield
------------------

tex bytefield.ins       <== Produces bytefield.sty (the package proper)
latex bytefield.dtx     <== Produces bytefield.dvi (the documentation)
makeindex -s gind.ist bytefield.idx -o bytefield.ind  <== Writes an index
makeindex -s gglo.ist bytefield.glo -o bytefield.gls  <== Writes a change log
latex bytefield.dtx     <== Incorporates the index and change log into
                            bytefield.dvi

Note that bytefield comes with pre-built documentation.  Also, there
is an example.tex file that shows how one might include hyperlinks in
a protocol diagram.  example.tex needs the hyperref package and should
be run through pdfLaTeX, VTeX, dvipdfm, or any other backend that
supports hyperref hyperlinks.
