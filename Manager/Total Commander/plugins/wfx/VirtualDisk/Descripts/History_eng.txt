    |      Version history:      |
    \============================/

Version 1.3.3 Final (build 5300):
  1. Driver is now signed by the Christian Ghisler's digital signature, so that
     it can now work in Windows Vista/7 x64 without turning off the signature
     checks.
  2. Fixed security issue: Using the driver, users could access files which were
     otherwise inaccessible for them (fixed only for WinXP or newer!).
  3. Mounting of compressed and encrypted images is forbidden. Reason: a bug in
     Windows can lead to dead lock.
  4. Added Traditional Chinese interface translation (Sheree Chen).
  5. In the image properties dialog focus is set on the Mount/Unmount button by
     default.
  6. Implemented a new command-line tool vd_filedisk.exe for mounting and
     unmounting images independently from TC (available separately).
  7. Source codes for the driver and vd_filedisk.exe are published under GPL.
  8. Added 64-bit version.

Version 1.3.2 (driver only):
  1. Driver was updated according to the changes in original FileDisk driver

     version 1.15.0.0:

  2. Bug fixed which caused the images unmounted because of a reboot to look still mounted.
  3. Added 64-bit drivers: one tested for Windows x64 and one experimental for Windows 64-bit
     (Intel Itanium).
  4. Two German language files were added (by Frank Bultge and Peter Brockamp).
  5. Several small fixes.

Version 1.30 beta 2:
  1. The driver is redesigned so that the plugin does not need administrator priviledges to work.
     They are needed for installing the driver only.
  2. Besides the new driver installation methode (by means of INF-file) the old one (which needs
     copying of the driver file and importing the data into the registry) has been added, because
     the new methode did not suit to some systems.
  3. The NRG-files are now added into the plugin in CD/DVD mode by default, as this format in some
     cases can be mounted and recognized by the system correctly.
  4. For the experiment, the 64-bit version of the driver VD_FileDisk has been added.

Version 1.30 beta 1:
  1. Added floppy drive emulation mode.
  2. The driver was renamed from FileDisk into VD_FileDisk so that there were no conflitcs with other
     programs using the similar driver (for example WinImage 7.0+).
  3. Driver installation is made simplier (by means of INF-file).
  4. Added Polish interface translation (Pawel Wawrzyszko).
  5. Added Ukranian interface translation (Butsky Igor).

Version 1.26:
  1. Fixed bug when the name of "Mounting mode" group box was not translated.
  2. Changed font from MS Sans Serif to "virtual" MS Shell Dlg so that it could be easily changed
     on every system.
  3. Added French (Claude Charries) and Spanish (Luis Mejia) interface translations.

Version 1.25:
  1. The plugin now supports LNG-files for changing its language. The language can be chosen
     by calling the "About" box ("Properties" item in the context menu, or pressing Alt+Enter
     on the "Virtual Disks") and pressing the "Settings" button. There are two languages in
     the plugin package: Russian and English, the second is default.
  2. In the dialogs the hotkeys were added for quick moving between controls (underlined
     letters).
  3. The program Convert.exe is removed from the package as it was needed for very old version
     only.
  4. Added file pluginst.inf for automatic install in Total Commander 6.5+.

Version 1.20:
  1. In this version the updated Bo Brenten's driver filedisk.sys is used (1.0.0.13). The
     previous version used in the plugin had a bug which involved memory leaks. These leaks caused
     the system work more and more slowly till it completely hangs.
     Also, this driver works better with large CD-images (larger than 700 MB).

Version 1.10:

  3. Added checking of the file type on file copying.
  4. Fixed several bugs in copiing/removing files.
  5. It is not allowed now to remove image if it is mounted without unmounting.

Version 1.00:
  The first version. It can mount images in format ISO, BIN (in CD-mode) and IMG (in RW- and RO-modes).
