KOMA-Script is a versatile bundle of LaTeX2e document classes and
packages.  It aims to be a replacement to the standard LaTeX2e
classes.  KOMA-Script does not stop with the features known from the
standard classes, but it extends the possibilities in order to
provide the user an almost complete working environment.

scraddr - Package to provide data from scrlttr2's adr-files
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Maintainer:     Markus Kohm
E-Mail:         komascript at gmx info
Abstract:       scraddr is a LaTeX package of the KOMA-Script bundle.
                scrlttr2 uses adr-files to create form letters. The scraddr
                package provides commands to read such files and to use the
                data of the address entries not only with the scrlttr2 class
                and not only for form letters.

scrartcl - versatile class may be used as a drop-in replacement of article
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Maintainer:     Markus Kohm
E-Mail:         komascript at gmx info
Abstract:       scrartcl is a LaTeX class of the KOMA-Script bundle. It is
                the KOMA-Script drop-in replacement for the standard LaTeX
                article class. It provides all options, environments,
                counters, lengths and commands of the standard LaTeX article
                class, as well as several additional options, environments,
                commands, etc. to make it much more versatile. The default
                layout of scrartcl differs from article, with an emphasis on
                good typography. Nevertheless, by changing the defaults, you
                can achieve a layout very similar to that of the standard
                class.
Requires:       scrkbase - internal KOMA-Script package

Maintainer:     Markus Kohm
E-Mail:         komascript at gmx info
Abstract:       scrreport is a very simple wrapper class to scrartcl. Is has
                been made, because several younger KOMA-Script users doe not
                understand the 8.3 name scheme.

                However it is still recommended to use scrartcl instead of
                scrarticle.

scrbase - basic features for KOMA-Script, e.g. conditionals and key=value
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Maintainer:     Markus Kohm
E-Mail:         komascript at gmx info
Abstract:       scrbase is a LaTeX package of the KOMA-Script bundle.  It
                provides some basic functions used by KOMA-Script that can
                also be used by authors and users of other classes and
                packages.

                First, it provides extended handling of key=value pairs
                that can be used for run-time options of classes and
                packages. Several packages in a family can share options,
                and all the options in a family can be changed with a
                single command.

                Additional conditions like \ifundefinedorrelax, \ifpdftex,
                \ifVTeX, \ifpdfoutput, \ifstr etc. are provided. Most of
                them can be prevented from being defined and have
                additional internal representations that can be used by
                package or class authors.

                It also provides commands to easily define or change
                language-dependent terms that work not only with babel but
                with other packages like ngerman too.

                It provides some commands for package and class authors
                missing in the LaTeX kernel like \ClassInfoNoLine,
                \PackageInfoNoLine or \l@addto@macro.

                Last but not least, it provides commands for integer
                division and integer modulo operation that can be used,
                for example, inside \numexpr ...\relax or with \ifnum.
Requires:       keyval   - key=value package from the graphics bundle

scrbook - versatile class may be used as a drop-in replacement of book
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Maintainer:     Markus Kohm
E-Mail:         komascript at gmx info
Abstract:       scrbook is a LaTeX class of the KOMA-Script bundle and a
                drop-in replacement for the standard LaTeX book class. It 
                provides all options, environments, commands, etc. of the
                standard LaTeX book class, as well as several additional 
                options, environments, commands, etc. to make it much more
                versatile. The default layout of scrbook differs from book,
                with an emphasis on good typography. Nevertheless, by changing
                the defaults, you can achieve a layout very similar to that
                of the standard class.

Abstract:       scrdate is a LaTeX package of the KOMA-Script bundle. It
                provides several operations with calender dates, e.g., show
                the century or the decade of a year, calculate the day of
                the week of a given calender date, show the current
                calender date in ISO form. It has support for several
                languages, including English, German, French, Italian,
                Spanish, Croatian, Finnish, Norsk, Swedish, Danish, Polish,
                Czech, and Slovak.

scrdoc - internal source documentation class of KOMA-Script
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Maintainer:     Markus Kohm
E-Mail:         komascript at gmx info
Abstract:       scrdoc is an internal LaTeX class of the KOMA-Script bundle.
                It is an extension of ltxdoc.  KOMA-Script uses scrdoc for
                the implementation documentation and the documentation of
                packages that aren't KOMA-Script core packages.  Currently
                there is no user manual for this class because the
                only user is the KOMA-Script maintainer.
Requires:       ltxdoc   - the LaTeX2e source documentation class

Abstract:       scrhack is a LaTeX package of the KOMA-Script bundle. It
                patches other packages to make them work better and adds new
                features to improve their interaction with KOMA-Script. One
                main feature is to make them work with tocbasic instead of
                KOMA-Script's deprecated float list interface. Currently,
                patches for float.sty, floatrow.sty, (old versions of)
                hyperref, listings, and setspace are available.
Requires:       scrkbase - internal KOMA-Script package with basics

E-Mail:         komascript at gmx info
Abstract:       scrkbase is an internal KOMA-Script packages that provides
                some features that are common to several KOMA-Script
                classes and packages. Users and class or package authors

scrlayer-fancyhdr - combining scrlayer with fancyhdr
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Maintainer:     Markus Kohm
E-Mail:         komascript at gmx info
Abstract:       scrlayer-fancyhdr is a LaTeX package of the KOMA-Script
                bundle. It uses KOMA-Script package scrlayer to redefine
                the page styles of package fancyhdr as layer page styles.
                This allows the combination of features of fancyhdr with
                features of scrlayer.

                Like most of the KOMA-Script packages, you can use this
                package not only with KOMA-Script classes but also with
                several other classes, e.g., the standard LaTeX classes.
Requires:       scrlayer.sty - KOMA-Script package

scrlayer-notecolumn - control note columns parallel to the main text
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Maintainer:     Markus Kohm
E-Mail:         komascript at gmx info
Abstract:       scrlayer-notecolumn is a LaTeX package of the KOMA-Script
                bundle. It provides an end-user interface to scrlayer to
                define and manage note columns. Those note columns are
                somewhat similar to marginal notes (see the LaTeX
                command \marginpar or packages like notecolumn), but you
                can use several of them. The package provides page breaks
                inside note columns and synchronization points between the
                main text and note columns.

                Like most of the KOMA-Script packages, you can use this
                package not only with KOMA-Script classes but also with
                several other classes, e.g., the standard LaTeX classes.

scrlayer-scrpage - controlling page headers and footers
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Maintainer:     Markus Kohm
E-Mail:         komascript at gmx info
Abstract:       scrlayer-scrpage is a LaTeX package of the KOMA-Script
                bundle. It provides an end-user interface to scrlayer to
                define and manage page styles. This end user interface is
                sufficiently compatible to scrpage2 that users should easily
                be able to switch from the old scrpage2 package to the new
                one. Nevertheless, it provides several new features to control
                headers and footers.

                Like most of the KOMA-Script packages, you can use this
                package not only with KOMA-Script classes but also with
                several other classes, e.g., the standard LaTeX classes.

scrlayer - defining layers and controlling page headers and footers
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Maintainer:     Markus Kohm
E-Mail:         komascript at gmx info
Abstract:       scrlayer is a LaTeX package of the KOMA-Script bundle.
                Users may already be familiar with a type of layer from
                packages like eso-pic or textpos. scrlayer is another package
                that provides background and foreground layers, but unlike
                those other packages, these layers are part of the page-style
                definition. With this package, you can easily switch between
                the layers used by switching the page style.

                In short, the page-style interface of scrlayer provides
                commands to define page styles based on a stack of layers and
                to manage those layer stacks. 

                Nevertheless, using the layers directly is recommended for
                advanced users only. End-user interfaces for beginners or
                average users are provided by additional packages, that
                load scrlayer on their own, e.g., scrlayer-scrpage.

scrlttr2 - versatile letter class with separation of text area and note paper
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Maintainer:     Markus Kohm
E-Mail:         komascript at gmx info
Abstract:       scrlttr2 is a letter class for LaTeX2e that allows
                definition of several letterheads and text area settings
                that are independent from the letterhead. So you can use
                not only the KOMA-Script package typearea but even packages
                like geometry to define the text area and the margins.

                The positions of the elements of the letterhead can be
                changed by so called pseudo-lengths. This makes it possible
                to adjust scrlttr2 not only to local conventions and paper
                sizes but also to a corporate brand identity.

                Several predefined sets of parameters, called
                letter-class-option or lco files are part of the
                KOMA-Script bundle: two German letters, Swiss letters, US
                letters, Japanese letters, and French letters.  More can be
                found on CTAN or the KOMA-Script homepage as separate
                packages.

                Additional lco-files for different letterheads can be found
                on the KOMA-Script homepage, e.g., one demonstration file
                for a letterhead similar to that of Washington State
                University.

scrreport - wrapper class to scrreprt
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Maintainer:     Markus Kohm
E-Mail:         komascript at gmx info
Abstract:       scrreport is a very simple wrapper class to scrreprt. Is has
                been made, because several younger KOMA-Script users doe not
                understand the 8.3 name scheme.

                However it is still recommended to use scrreprt instead of
                scrreport.

scrreprt - versatile class may be used as a drop-in replacement of report
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Maintainer:     Markus Kohm
E-Mail:         komascript at gmx info
Abstract:       scrreprt is the KOMA-Script drop-in replacement for the
                standard LaTeX report class. It provides all options,
                environments, counters, lengths, and commands of the standard
                LaTeX report class, as well as several additional options,
                environments, commands, etc., to make it much more versatile.
                The default layout of scrreprt differs from that of report,
                with an emphasis on good typography. Nevertheless, by changing
                the defaults, you can achieve a layout very similar to that of
                the standard class.

Abstract:       scrtime is a LaTeX package of the KOMA-Script bundle.  It

scrwfile - Spare write handles for helper files to avoid `No room' messages
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Maintainer:     Markus Kohm
E-Mail:         komascript at gmx info
Abstract:       scrwfile is a LaTeX package of the KOMA-Script bundle. TeX
                makes only about 16 write handles available for \newwrite.
                With LaTeX, each auxiliary file, not only the main aux file
                but files such as the toc file, the lof file, the lot file,
                and the raw indexes and glossaries need one of these
                handles. scrwfile provides facilities to avoid using
                handles for auxiliary files that use the main aux file for
                intermediate writing. This means that the toc file, the lof
                file, the lot file, and files of packages like listings no
                longer need a write handle, so the user will have more write
                handles for files like indexes or glossaries and can avoid
                `No room for new \write' error messages.

                scrwfile also provides facilities to clone auxiliary files,
                e.g., to have two tables of contents with different tocdepth
                settings.
Requires:       scrbase  - some basic features for class and package
                           authors
                tocbasic - basic features for helper files and lists of

tocbasic - Management of tables and lists of contents using helper files
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Maintainer:     Markus Kohm
E-Mail:         komascript at gmx info
Abstract:       tocbasic is a LaTeX package of the KOMA-Script bundle.  The
                main purpose of package tocbasic is to provide features for
                authors of classes and packages to create their own tables or
                lists of contents like the list of figures and the list of
                tables, and thereby allow other classes or packages some
                measure of control over these. For example, the tocbasic
                package delegates control of the language for all these tables
                and lists of contents to the babel package. Thus changes of
                language will be automatically reflected inside all these
                tables and lists of contents. Using tocbasic will free
                authors of classes and packages from the burden of
                implementing of such features.

                KOMA-Script itself uses tocbasic not only for the table of
                contents but also for the lists of figures and tables
                mentioned previously.
Requires:       scrbase  - KOMA-Script package for some basic features.

typearea - Calculating typeing area and margins depending on typographic rules
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Maintainer:     Markus Kohm
E-Mail:         komascript at gmx info
Abstract:       Many LaTeX classes, including the standard classes, present 
                the user with the largely fixed configuration of margins
                and type area.  With the standard classes, the choice is
                limited to selecting a font size. There are separate packages,
                such as geometry, which give the user complete control over,
                but also full responsibility for, setting the type area and
                margins.

                KOMA-Script takes a somewhat different approach with its
                typearea package. Users are offered ways to adjust the design
                and algorithms based on established typographic standards,
                making it easier for them to make good choices.
