Thai font support in the CJK package
------------------------------------

Version 4.8.4 of the CJK package has improved support for Thai. This file
describes how to install and use the fonts. Please refer to cjk-enc.txt how
to set up cjk-enc.el (which automatically loads thai-word.el for finding
word breaks).

The directory structure in utils/thaifont/texmf already reflects the
directory structure of a standard TEXMF tree, version 1.1. Example:

  utils/thaifont/texmf/fonts/enc/dvips/thai/c90.enc  ->
                        /usr/local/share/texmf/fonts/enc/dvips/thai/c90.enc

To create TFM files for other Thai fonts, use the utility files in the
`thaifont/tools' directory. Details how to do that can be found in
`thaifonts/tools/INSTALL'. The file thaifont/tools/c90.etx gives the
theoretical background on the used font encoding and ligature mechanism;
a pre-formatted version can be found in CJK's doc bundle.


Installation
------------

. It is assumed that you have already installed the main parts of the CJK
  package (as described in the doc/INSTALL file).

. Get the latest fonts-tlwg package from

    http://linux.thai.net/projects/thaifonts-scalable

  and install the Type 1 font families `garuda' and `norasi'. You should use
  fonts-tlwg version 0.5 or newer. Note, however, that this bundle no longer
  contains pre-compiled AFM files; instead, they are generated (together
  with Type 1 and TrueType versions of the font) with a bunch of tools using
  a configure script and a Makefile.

  Recommended locations are

    TEXMF/fonts/type1/public/{garuda,norasi}/  .

  Examples:

    garuda.pfb    -> TEXMF/fonts/type1/public/garuda/garuda.pfb
    norasi_bi.pfb -> TEXMF/fonts/type1/public/norasi/norasi_bi.pfb

  Note that the TeX metric files of font-tlwg bundle are incompatible with
  CJK's Thai implementation. Nevertheless, it is possible to use both at the
  same time if desired. This is the very reason that the Babel language
  support file of the CJK package is called `thaicjk.ldf', not `thai.ldf'.

. Install all files from utils/thaifont/texmf in your TEXMF tree. This
  should be straightforward.

. Font definition files for Thai are in CJK's texinput/thai directory. To
  simplify font handling with LaTeX, `gar' and `nrsr' are aliased to `cmr',
  `cmss', and `cmtt'. If you want to use other fonts, you have to adapt
  c90cmr.fd, c90cmss.fd, and c90cmtt.fd accordingly.

. There are two possibilities how to make the Thai PostScript fonts known to
  the various DVI drivers (and pdftex). The recommended way is to include
  the files `garuda-c90.map' and `norasi-c90.map' in the `updmap.cfg'
  configuration script by adding the following two lines:

    Map garuda-c90.map
    Map norasi-c90.map

  Older versions of updmap which don't have updmap.cfg must be patched
  directly by adding the map files to the `extra_modules' variable:

    extra_modules="
      garuda-c90.map
      norasi-c90.map
    "

  After executing updmap, the fonts are known to all programs which uses the
  map files.

  For dvips, you can also use the `config.norasi-c90' and `config.garuda-c90'
  files on the command line:

    dvips -P norasi-c90 ...

  This method doesn't work with pdfTeX (which doesn't understand the `-P'
  option).

. Run mktexlsr or a similar program to update the TEXMF file database.


Usage
-----

Thai support has been fully integrated into the Babel system. For example,
to have Thai as a secondary language and US English as the primary language,
say

  \documentclass{...}

  ...
  \usepackage[thaicjk,USenglish]{babel}
  ...


  \begin{document}

  ...
  \begin{otherlanguage}{thaicjk}
  Thai text
  \end{otherlanguage}

  ...

`thaicjk' changes the baseline stretch to 1.2, activates \frenchspacing, and
modifies the \today command to use the proper Thai values and names.

The just sketched outline works without cjk-enc also (but no word breaks are
inserted automatically); you must then insert

  \addto\extrasthaicjk{\fontencoding{C90}\selectfont}

in the preamble of your document to make Babel switch to Thai font encoding
on entering the `thaicjk' language environment.

For use of cjk-enc.el please read `cjk-enc.txt'.
