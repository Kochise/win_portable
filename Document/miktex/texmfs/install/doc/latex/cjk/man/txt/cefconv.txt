NAME
       cefconv  -  convert  a TeX document containing CEF macros into `prepro-
       cessed' form.

SYNOPSIS
       cefconv < infile > outfile

DESCRIPTION
       The Chinese Encoding Framework (CEF)  developed  by  Christian  Wittern
       <cwittern@conline.central.de>  makes it possible to include CJK charac-
       ters in various encodings using the SGML macros &CX-aabb; for Big 5 and
       CNS encoding and &U-aabb; for Unicode (X denotes a number between 0 and
       7; 0 represents Big 5 encoding, 1-7 CNS encoding planes 1-7.   aabb  is
       either a decimal or hexadecimal number)

       cefconv  converts  the  CEF  macros into a form which can directly pro-
       cessed with LaTeX 2e.

       This filter is part of the CJK macro package for LaTeX 2e.
