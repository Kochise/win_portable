This bundle contains the the adjustbox package and its auxiliary packages trimclip and adjcalc.
The initial purpose of adjustbox was to supplement the standard graphics/x package, 
which defines the macros \resizebox, \scalebox and \rotatebox, with the macros \trimbox and \clipbox.
An additional \marginbox macro is also provided.
These macros are now placed in the dedicated package trimclip which is loaded by adjustbox.
The package comes with clipping driver files are provided for pdftex (incl. LuaLaTeX), dvips and xetex. A
fall-back driver which uses the pgf package is still included. 
The driver files got written by Joseph Wright (LaTeX3 project) and the package author.

The main feature of adjustbox is the general \adjustbox macro which extends the key=value
interface of \includegraphics from the graphicx package, and applies it to general text
content. It also provides further text/box modifications keys, macros and envionments.

Both adjustbox and trimclip use the adjcalc package to allow for algebraic expressions for all length
arguments. The adjcalc package can use either e-TeX, the calc package or the pgfmath package.

All macros use the authors other package collectbox to read the content as box and not as
macro argument. This allows for all forms of content including special material like verbatim content.
A special feature of collectbox is used to provide matching environments with the identical names as the
macros.
