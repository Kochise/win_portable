THE APACITE PACKAGE
===================

Description
-----------

The apacite package (for LaTeX and BibTeX) implements the requirements
of the American Psychological Association concerning citations and
reference list. In addition, it provides a large number of options and
other possibilities for customization, so that a wide range of citation
styles and reference list styles can be handled. Furthermore, it also
provides the possibility of automatically generating an author index.

Building the package and its documentation
------------------------------------------

The generated LaTeX package (.sty), BibTeX style (.bst), and supporting
files (.apc, .bib, .drv, .tex) are extracted by running:

tex apacite.ins

The documentation is then generated by the following sequence:

pdflatex apacite.drv  <== Produces apacite.pdf (documentation)
bibtex   apacite      <== Produces apacite.bbl (reference list)
pdflatex apacite.drv  <== Include ref. list
pdflatex apacite.drv  <== Resolve citations
pdflatex apacite.drv  <== 'Labels may have changed'
makeindex -o apacite.and apacite.adx <== (author index)
pdflatex apacite.drv  <== Include author index
pdflatex apacite.drv  <== Resolve table of contents

Note that apacite comes with pre-built documentation (PDF format,
U.S. letter-sized paper), so you only need to regenerate the
documentation if you are unhappy with the documentation as
provided. For example, if you want to generate a version for
A4 paper, or if you want the full reference manual, including the
documented source code and change log. In the latter case,
edit the file apacite.drv according to your wishes (see the comments
in that file) and insert the following lines in the sequence, after
generating the author index:

makeindex -s gind.ist apacite <== Produces apacite.ind (code index)
makeindex -s gglo.ist -o apacite.gls apacite.glo  <== (change log)
