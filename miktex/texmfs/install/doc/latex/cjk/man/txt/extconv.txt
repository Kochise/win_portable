EXTCONV(1)                  General Commands Manual                 EXTCONV(1)



NAME
       extconv  - convert a TeX document in either Big 5+ or GBK encoding into
       `preprocessed' form.

SYNOPSIS
       extconv < infile > outfile

DESCRIPTION
       Big 5+ and GBK encodings use the characters {, }, and \ which have spe-
       cial meanings in TeX documents.

       After  processing  a  LaTeX 2e  document which contains such characters
       with extconv you need not care about these special characters.

       This filter is part of the CJK macro package for LaTeX 2e.
