// FURTHER EXPLORATION
//  If you completed all the other tutorials you might want to put your new 
//  skills to use and do some exploration on your own. 
//  Here comes the bad news: Even though this tutorial contains some code that 
//  would compile, the code doesn't make much sense. So trying to explore this 
//  project any further would be rather unproductive.
//  The good news is: In addition to this tutorial Sourcetrail also ships with a real
//  example project that implements the game Tic-Tac-Toe! You can open the 
//  project via the "Project -> Recent Projects" menu.
//  You can also start exploring your own projects by creating a new Sourcetrail 
//  project where you can add all your source and include paths.
