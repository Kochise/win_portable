This folder contains the templates for new documents created in
Inkscape. They're listed in the "File > New From Template..." submenu.
A template may store any document-specific settings (such as initial
zoom and view, paper size, background and borders, metadata, window
geometry, grid and guide settings, export hints) as well as any
objects. To add a new template, simply use "File > Save Template".
Alternatively you can manually save or copy it into this folder or
(preferred option) to the corresponding "templates" directory in your
profile directory.

Procedural templates are located in the adjacent 'extensions'
directory. By convention, they begin with 'empty_'.


## Default template ##

At startup or when creating a new document, Inkscape will load the
default template, which is named "default.svg". A localized version in
the current locale (default.*.svg) will be preferred over the English
version if available. To customize the default template simply use
"File > Save Template" and make sure to enable "Set as default
template". Alternatively you can manually edit the files in this
folder or (preferred option) save or copy them to the corresponding
"templates" directory in your profile directory. Default templates in
the profile directory will always be preferred over the stock versions
that ship with Inkscape (i.e. the files in this folder).
