29.10.10 Fixed: Could not abort ftp upload while retrying 3 times (e.g. because target was write protected)
27.10.10 Fixed: Watch directory changes: When receiving notification about file rename and both old and new name exist in the list, then remove the old name from the list

22.10.10 Fixed: wincmd.ini: TreeFileLocation option didn't support pseudo environment variables like %$LOCAL_APPDATA%
22.10.10 Fixed: No shield overlay icons shown on Windows 7 because function LoadIconWithScaleDown is missing in comctl32.dll
17.10.10 Fixed: Copy names with path to clipboard sometimes exported drives as uppercase after search - feed to listbox
17.10.10 Fixed: Increased maximum possible stack size from 1/4 to 1/2 MByte, otherwise some plugins like ShellDetails may crash on load

15.10.10 Added: Calculate occupied space: Show size also in kBytes, MBytes and GBytes
15.10.10 Added: Button bar, start menu: Two new placeholders, %v and %V: Adds virtual file name (%v: just the name, %V: with full path) instead of redirected path to command line in plugins like Temporary panel

12.10.10 Fixed: Moving selected folders+files to their parent (drag to [..]) could overwrite files, e.g. when a subdir contains files with same name -> move this subdir at the very end (see http://www.hardtoc.com/archives/198)

12.10.10 Fixed: Windows 7 theme for Vista (with patched uxtheme.dll) causes distorted headers (Name, Ext, Size etc)

05.10.10 Fixed: Directory hotlist: cd ftp://user:pass@server.com/path/ didn't work if the user name or password contained an asterisk (*) character (make sure the path ends with a slash to make it work)
05.10.10 Fixed: Regular expressions, Unicode (e.g. in multi-rename tool): Disallow pattern ^?? because it causes a crash (replace by ^? as for ANSI regex searches)
01.10.10 Fixed: Drag&Drop from search->feed to listbox not working on network shares. Now it should work when all selected files are on the same share (\\server\share)
30.09.10 Fixed: Don't check for shield overlay icon on UNC paths because it seems to be very slow
30.09.10 Fixed: File lists: Cache per file icons again, so they show up immediately when they were shown before, but always reload them in the background thread
30.09.10 Fixed: Lister didn't support case-insensitive backwards search in UTF-8 files
30.09.10 Fixed: Start editing comment (Ctrl+Z) while background packing of TGZ archive active, save comment (F2) -> access violation (only occurs when 'watch directory changes' is off)

28.09.10 Fixed: Create CRC checksums, give name of existing directory as target file name -> Error that controls were deleted in background thread
28.09.10 Fixed: Windows Vista/7: Do not follow junctions (reparse points) located on network drives when the target drive differs, because the stored target is an absolute path, so the redirection would go to a local directory
28.09.10 Fixed: RAR packer: -sfx was passed twice to the packer when creating self-extracting archives
28.09.10 Fixed: Verify CRC checksums: Could not abort verification while no files were found to be checked, e.g. because the crc file was moved to a different directory

27.09.10 Fixed: Configuration - Change button bar: Icons appeared on multiple lines when using high dpi settings (e.g. 175 dpi)
27.09.10 Fixed: Delete directories, one of them is locked because it's the current dir in another program -> user closes program, clicks "retry" -> only that directory is deleted, but the delete operation stops
27.09.10 Fixed: Also ignore trailing spaces in XXE-Encoded files
27.09.10 Fixed: Select files (Num+"+"): Function couldn't handle selection by size properly for files > 2GB

26.09.10 Fixed: Handle faulty ftp servers which return Unix file listing in reply to MLSD command (instead of MLSD format)

02.07.10 Fixed: Load per file icons (e.g. exe/lnk) always in background, not only on first load (should make network drives more responsive)
02.07.10 Fixed: When deleting files as admin from system32 while x64DisableRedirection=1, redirect calls to tcmadmin to SysNative (will work on XP64 only when installing Microsoft patch)

27.06.10 Fixed: Send OPTS MLST command when server doesn't send all fields by default (e.g. UNIX.mode)

27.06.10 Fixed: Synchronize dirs with files which differ only in case: Re-alignment stopped after the first matching file
27.06.10 Added: Allow user to choose whether Ctrl+C should use Explorer extensions or not (default is no, it's much faster): wincmd.ini [Configuration] UseFastCtrlC=1/0  (Set to 0 to use Explorer extensions)

22.06.10 Fixed: Dynamically create copyright notice with Unicode in Splash screen so it also works on e.g. Chinese Windows

15.06.10 Added: Call network connect function with CONNECT_PROMPT option to prompt for user name: wincmd.ini [Configuration] PromptForUser=1
15.06.10 Fixed: FTP: When "Send commands" also contained a CWD command, reconnecting to an ftp server via history went to that directory instead of the directory in the history

13.06.10 Added: "cd" command in button bar and user menu: When parameter /user: is added without giving a user name, call connect function with CONNECT_PROMPT option to prompt for user name
13.06.10 Fixed: Look for key file also under %LOCALAPPDATA%\VirtualStore on Windows Vista/7 if TC is installed in "Program files" dir (reason: some older mail programs may store the key there!)

31.05.10 Added: Synchronize dirs with FTP when files with same name but different case exist, e.g. index.htm + INDEX.HTM -> just show these files in red and ignore them (can be viewed or deleted)

23.05.10 Fixed: TC hangs when trying to unpack 0 byte file created by packer izarcc (reason: compression is set to bzip2, but no data present)
21.05.10 Fixed: TcUsbRun.exe not adding menu items to insert notification dialog on Vista x64 -> need to write to 64-bit registry branch
21.05.10 Fixed: Synchronize dirs: Main window could become accessible when synchronizing via port connection

Fixes after Total Commander 7.04a:
23.11.08  Fixed: Command line: Access violation when "cd" command was longer than 259 characters
21.11.08  Fixed: Search function: Regex search ignored empty search string (bug in Regexpr library) -> assume .*
21.11.08  Fixed: Access violation when trying to unpack multiple files from locked RAR. Reason: RAROpenArchive returned 0, but TC expected INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE
21.11.08  Fixed: Access violation when adding too many files to command line with Shift+Drag&Drop
29.10.08  Fixed: Auto-resume upload could restart at position 0 of the file if the server or connection was very slow, and didn't support the SIZE command
21.10.08  Fixed: Could not unpack files from zip if they were both stored and in stream format (size+crc at the end)
09.09.08  Fixed: Alt+Cursor left/right (history back/forward) could add '?' character to command line with U.S. keyboard
05.09.08  Fixed: Lister: Search function didn't report an error when searching backwards when the last match was at the beginning of the file
05.09.08  Fixed: Lister: regex search backwards could not find first 'a' in string like 'aaaaaa'
05.09.08  Added: Allow to copy NTFS permissions also from NTFS drives with 8k clusters (or larger). These are detected by mistake as Samba drives because they do not support NTFS compression
05.09.08  Fixed: Copy files from zip to zip: temporary files were not deleted when user aborts the first (unpacking) step
20.08.08  Fixed: Vista x64 only: Windows Open/Save file dialog not working with x64DisableRedirection=1 -> turn it off (downside: cannot open 64-bit dll files in lister this way)
20.08.08  Fixed: Access violation (not critical) when trying to modify ZIP archives created with SharpZipLib (due to invalid ZIP64 headers)
20.08.08  Fixed: Added linebreak after "Create shortcuts of .. files in" confirmation dialog when dropping files from Explorer with Ctrl+Shift
