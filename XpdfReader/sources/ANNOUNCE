Subject: ANNOUNCE: Xpdf 4.02 - a PDF viewer and related tools

Glyph & Cog, LLC is pleased to announce a new version of Xpdf, the
open source Portable Document Format (PDF) viewer.  The Xpdf project
also includes a PDF text extractor, PDF-to-PostScript converter, and
various other utilities.

Xpdf uses the Qt toolkit and runs on Linux and Windows.  The
non-graphical components (pdftops, pdftotext, etc.) run on Linux,
Unix, Windows, MacOSX, and pretty much any other system with a decent
C++ compiler.

4.02 is primarily a bug fix release.  There are some new features:

* Pdftohtml now extracts embedded fonts.

* Various user interface tweaks in XpdfReader: added a button to
  toggle sidebar visibilty, added menu items to toggle the sidebar and
  toolbar, added the 'initialDisplayMode', 'initialToolbarState', and
  'initialSelectMode' xpdfrc settings.

* If XpdfReader is already running, double-clicking on a PDF file (or
  dragging-and-dropping it on the XpdfReader icon) opens the file in a
  new tab (via the new '-open' command line switch).

See the `CHANGES' file for a complete list of changes.

Source (C++ and C) is available, and it should be fairly easy to
compile for Linux and Windows.

More information, source code, and precompiled binaries are on the
xpdf web page:
