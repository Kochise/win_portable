Handling of space between Kanji and non-Kanji characters.


1. Shibuaki or Yonbuaki (四分あき)

    This space is called "Shibuaki" which has a width of a quarter of a kanji
    font width. It is used only between Kanji and non-Kanji characters.
    (between Kanji and Kanji only stretchable glue is used; between
    ASCII and ASCII ordinary space.)

    1   Shibuaki space only between previous kanji character and the
        ASCII character.

          <Kanji character> <ASCII character><Kanji Character>
                           ^            
                        shibuaki

    2   Shibuaki space only between next kanji character and the ASCII
        character.

          <Kanji character><ASCII character> <Kanji Character>
                                            ^            
                                         shibuaki

    3   Shibuaki spaces between kanji characters and ASCII word.

          <Japanese Text> English word <Japanese Text>
                         ^            ^
                      shibuaki     shibuaki
