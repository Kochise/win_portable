##chain arrow multi attribute
##You can specify multiple arrows with one arrow symbol by listing a comma separated list of starting or ending blocks.##You can also chain arrows by continuing with yet another block symbol.##When defining an arrow, add attributes after the ending (list of) block(s). If you auto-define an entity this way, the attribute will still be for the arrow.
