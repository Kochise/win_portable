NAME
       sjisconv  - convert a TeX document in SJIS encoding into `preprocessed'
       form.

SYNOPSIS
       sjisconv < infile > outfile

DESCRIPTION
       SJIS encoding for Japanese uses the characters {, }, and \  which  have
       special meanings in TeX documents.

       After  processing  a  LaTeX 2e  document which contains SJIS characters
       with sjisconv you need not care about these special characters.

       This filter is part of the CJK macro package for LaTeX 2e.
