This is the file INSTALL of the CJK macro package ver. 4.8.4 (18-Apr-2015).

Installation Guide
==================

It is probably a good idea to get a packaged version of CJK---be warned that
installing CJK is *not* trivial.

The easiest solution is to use the TeX Live CD which is distributed among
members of TeX user groups worldwide. It comes with a ready-to-run CJK setup
together with basic CJK fonts (in outline format if freely available) for
almost all encodings. To get a recent snapshot, try the SVN archive. See

  http://www.tug.org/texlive/svn/

for more details.

. Using web sites like http://rpmseek.com you can find and download CJK
  packages for most GNU/Linux distributions like SuSE or Debian.

. For FreeBSD try this:

    http://www.freebsd.org/ports/chinese.html

. MikTeX also provides packages for CJK.


Here a check list for the impatient (experienced) user which tries to show
whether you've done all steps to install the CJK package and fonts. It is
assumed that you want to install both ttf2pk and hbf2gf.

Detailed explanations can be found below.


--- begin checklist ---------------------------------------------------------

. Have you installed a LaTeX 2e version newer or equal to 2001/06/01? The
  version of LaTeX is given in each log file produced by LaTeX. For using
  CJKutf8.sty you even need version 2003/12/01.

. Have you removed an older version of CJK? If not, do it now but don't
  forget to save your FD and other files which you have changed! Don't
  forget also to remove the ttf2pk and hbf2gf binaries.

. Can the texinput tree of the CJK package be found by your TeX
  implementation? Have you activated subdirectory searching?

. Have you downloaded the needed font packages (either ps, hbf or ttf)? See
  also contrib/wadalab/DNP.txt for the Japanese Wadalab fonts. Have you
  moved the TFM files into your TFM-tree (or updated TFMINPUTS accordingly)?
  Ditto for VF files if needed.

. Have you installed ttf2pk and ttf2tfm from the FreeType 1 package (only
  needed for TrueType fonts)? Note that FreeType 2 won't work.

. Have you run ttf2tfm to create the proper TFM files from your TrueType
  fonts? This won't be done automatically via mktextfm or MakeTeXTFM!

. Have you updated the ttfonts.map file for ttf2pk? Have you updated the
  various hbf2gf config files? Have you copied them to the right places?
  Don't forget to install ttf2pk's SFD and other data files which define the
  various CJK subfonts and encodings.

. Have you modified and installed the script files for automatic font
  generation (not necessary for teTeX 1.0 or newer)?

. If you want Thai support, have you followed the instructions given in
  thaifont.txt?


web2c/teTeX users:

. Do you have a C compiler and a make program available for compilation? GNU
  gcc and GNU make are recommended.

. Have you updated special.map?

. Have you used the options --with-kpathsea-include=... and
  --with-kpathsea-lib=... while calling the configure script of hbf2gf
  (or ttf2pk)? Otherwise no file searching library is used which yields
  surprising results... Note: Don't use `/usr/include/kpathsea', for
  example, but `/usr/include' as an argument to --with-kpathsea-include.

. To check whether kpathsea correctly finds HBF files and configuration
  files for hbf2gf, say:

    kpsewhich -progname=hbf2gf -format='misc fonts' <your_font>.hbf
    kpsewhich -progname=hbf2gf -format='other text files' <your_file>.cfg

  The same for TrueType fonts and the ttf2pk config file:

    kpsewhich -progname=ttf2pk <your_font>.ttf
    kpsewhich -progname=ttf2pk -format='other text files' ttfonts.map

  [Recent kpathsea versions (like 3.5.5) which come with the new teTeX or
   TeXLive distributions have a new variable `TEXFONTMAPS' for map files;
   you should use this test

     kpsewhich -progname=ttf2pk -format=map ttfonts.map

   instead of the last one.]

. Have you compiled the various *conv utility programs (like bg5conv)? Have
  you installed them together with the caller scripts (like bg5latex) in
  your path? FOR BIG 5 ENCODING YOU SHOULD ALWAYS USE bg5latex or
  bg5pdflatex (except if you use cjk-enc.el). FOR SJIS ENCODING YOU SHOULD
  ALWAYS USE sjislatex or sjispdflatex.

. Have you updated and controlled the texmf.cnf configuration file or set
  the various environment variables? (TEXINPUTS, TFMFONTS, PKFONTS,
  MISCFONTS, TTFONTS, probably TTF2PKINPUTS, TTF2TFMINPUTS, HBF2GFINPUTS)

. ttf2pk and hbf2gf should be in the same directory where your TeX binaries
  like `texconfig' or `gftopk' are (or you must set TEXMFCNF and probably
  TEXMF in the environment). Soft links won't work!

. Finally, have you run texhash (or mktexlsr) after finishing all other
  things?


emTeX users:

. Have you created a LaTeX format file which allows plain 8bit input and
  output without using any TeX Code Page (tcp)?

. Have you installed 4DOS (4OS2 or Take Command) for running the file
  dvidrv.btm?

. Have you configured dvidrv.btm?

. Have you installed the various *conv utility programs (like bg5conv)?
  together with the caller scripts (like bg5latex.bat)? FOR BIG 5 ENCODING
  YOU SHOULD ALWAYS USE bg5latex.bat . FOR SJIS ENCODING YOU SHOULD ALWAYS
  USE sjisltx.bat .

. Have you created and installed TFM files for fonts not in a CJK font
  package?

. Check whether you have updated all needed environment variables (TEXINPUT,
  TEXTFM, TTFONTS, TTFCFG, HBFONTS, HBFCFG) and your dvidrv configuration
  file or files (+font-files, +virtual-fonts).


In case of errors, verify the list step by step. Detailed information for
each step can be found in the documentation files of CJK. Under web2c or
teTeX, you can set the KPATHSEA_DEBUG environment variable to -1, then all
debugging info is shown and sent to stderr; it is *highly* recommended that
you read the kpathsea.info files. Under emTeX, read the various
documentation files, especially dvidrv.doc and tex.doc, and check the log
file of your dvi driver.

For hbf2gf, read hbf2gf.txt and its manual page (hbf2gf.1 or a formatted
version of it). Similarly, more info on ttf2tfm and ttf2pk can be found in
ttf2pk.doc and the manual pages ttf2pk.1 and ttf2tfm.1 (or a formatted
version).

--- end checklist -----------------------------------------------------------



Unix (web2c and teTeX)
----------------------

. If you can become root, rename the `texinput' directory tree of CJK into
  `CJK' or something else and add it to your (local) web2c texinput tree
  (for example, /usr/local/share/texmf.local/tex/latex/CJK).

. If you can't become root, modify the TEXINPUTS environment variable
  instead so that it includes the CJK directory; use a command similar to

    setenv TEXINPUTS :<your CJK directory>//

  to let TeX search the standard directories and your CJK tree, e.g.,

    setenv TEXINPUTS :/home/joe_user/CJK/4_3.0/texinput//

  (Note the leading double colon to append a path, and the double slash to
  activate subdirectory searching---for details see the kpathsea info
  files.)

  [Recent teTeX and TeXLive versions automatically search a TEXMF tree in
   your home directory called `texmf'.]

  See contrib/wadalab/DNP.txt for the Japanese Wadalab fonts.

. Edit the FD files of the encodings you want to use to specify the fonts
  you have. An explanation of the additional size commands CJK provides can
  be found in fonts.txt .

  Note: Most FD example files from the CJK package are set up for PS fonts
  from the TeXLive distribution.

  If you use the CJK font packages (see below) no changes are needed.

. [In case you plan to use only outline fonts (PFB, TTF) you can omit the
   installation of hbf2gf and HBF fonts.]

  If necessary, create TFM (and PK) files from CJK bitmaps with hbf2gf
  (found in utils/hbf2gf). This program comes with a configure script; say
  `./configure --help' in the utils/hbf2gf directory for configuration
  options. You need a compiled kpathsea library and its header files; in
  most cases you say

    ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/TeX \
                --with-kpathsea-include=<INCLUDEDIR> \
                --with-kpathsea-lib=<LIBDIR>
    make
    make install

  for a normal compilation and installation. Replace `/usr/local/TeX' with a
  path to your TeX distribution, and <DIR> with the directory one level
  higher than the library and the include files themselves. Example:
  libkpathsea.a is in /usr/local/TeX/lib/i686-linux, kpathsea.h is in
  /usr/local/TeX/include/kpathsea; then <LIBDIR> should be
  `/usr/local/TeX/TeX/lib/i686-linux', and <INCLUDEDIR> should be
  `/usr/local/TeX/include' (and not `/usr/local/TeX/include/kpathsea).

  See hbf2gf.txt, the man page (hbf2gf.1), and the documentation of the
  source file (hbf2gf.dvi) for further details. Usually it is sufficient to
  let hbf2gf create a complete set of TFM files; PK fonts are then created
  on demand.

  Older kpathsea versions need a patched MakeTeXPK or mktexpk script; you
  should apply the proper patch(es) from utils/hbf2gf/scripts. No changes to
  the script files are necessary for teTeX 1.0 and newer.

  The CJK font packages already contain TFM (and VF) files arranged for the
  (new) TDS directory structure; add it directly to your TEXMF tree.

. Free Chinese TrueType fonts (for both simplified and traditional Chinese)
  with a license similar to the GPL can be found on

    ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/nongnu

  and its mirrors worldwide. You might also search websites of companies
  offering WWW browser; they often come with CJK language packs which
  contain CJK TrueType fonts.

  Please note that many CJK TrueType fonts only have a Unicode mapping
  table. You should use the SFD files from the ttf2pk package starting with
  the letter `U' (e.g., UKS.sfd) which maps Unicode fonts to language
  specific encoded subfonts as needed by the CJK package.

  The ttf2pk package found in the contrib/ttf2pk directory of

    ftp://ftp.freetype.org/pub/
            freetype/unstable/freetype1-contrib-current.tar.gz

  contains the two programs ttf2tfm and ttf2pk for converting TrueType fonts
  into TFM and PK fonts, respectively. By the way, this package is not
  restricted to CJK TrueType fonts; it works with other TrueType fonts too.
  Read the manual pages and the documentation for further information. For
  compilation you also need the FreeType 1 package:

    ftp://ftp.freetype.org/pub/freetype/unstable/freetype-current.tar.gz

. The font editor `fontforge' (available from http://fontforge.sf.net) is
  capable of generating Type 1 subfonts as needed by CJK from other formats
  like TTF, OTF or CID (using the subfont definition files from ttf2pk).
  Such subfonts should be usable by virtually all platforms.

  (Funnnily, fontforge uses the `.sfd' extension also for saving font files
  it creates.)

  Although fontforge needs the X Window System, it can be compiled without a
  graphical interface, using a scripting language to control font
  conversion. The directory `utils/subfonts' of the CJK package contains
  useful scripts for manipulating subfonts.

. It is recommended to add all CJK fonts which are converted to the PK font
  format (either with hbf2gf or ttf2pk) to the file special.map: Assuming
  that your PK fonts should be generated in

    $TEXMF/fonts/pk/modeless/gb2312/gsfs14/

  the proper entries would be

    gsfs1401  gb2312  gsfs14
    gsfs1402  gs2312  gsfs14
    ...

. Compile the small preprocessors in the utils subdirectories with

    cc -O -s -o bg5conv bg5conv.c
    cc -O -s -o sjisconv sjisconv.c
    cc -O -s -o cefconv cefconv.c
    cc -O -s -o cef5conv cef5conv.c
    cc -O -s -o cefsconv cefsconv.c
    cc -O -s -o extconv extconv.c

  and move them into TeX's bin directory (together with the shell scripts)
  or modify the PATH environment variable appropriately. (`cc' can be any C
  compiler.)

  The script files `...latex' make the use of these programs transparent.

. Move the man pages into your man1 directory tree.

. If you want to use Mule, emacs, or XEmacs together with the CJK package,
  you should install cjk-enc.el (in utils/lisp). See cjk-enc.txt for
  documentation. Choose the correct cjk-enc.el version---note that the Mule
  version has limited capabilities compared to the Emacs version.

  Move cjk-enc.el to a place which is searched by Mule (e.g.,
  /usr/local/lib/mule/site-lisp) and put the following line into your emacs
  file:

    (load-library "cjk-enc")

  The default directory for emacs is /usr/local/share/emacs/site-lisp.

  Note that you don't need cjk-enc.el in case you are editing UTF-8 encoded
  files only.

. If you mainly write Chinese or Japanese with Emacs or Mule, consider the
  use of cjktilde.el (in utils/lisp). This file contains a minor mode which
  exchanges the tilde key with the space key. See the documentation of
  \CJKtilde in CJK.txt for the reasons to use `~' in most cases instead of
  a space character.

  To install, move cjktilde.el to a place which is searched by Emacs or Mule
  (e.g., /usr/local/share/emacs/site-lisp) and put the following line into
  your .emacs file:

    (load-library "cjktilde")

  To toggle the CJK tilde mode say

    M-x cjk-tilde-mode

  You can then assign cjk-tilde-mode to a key, e.g., shift-insert.

. If you use AUCTeX you can try cjkspace.el instead of cjktilde.el; it works
  in a similar (but not identical) way and is special to LaTeX buffers. Move
  the file to the local lisp directory and put the following lines into your
  .emacs file:

    (autoload 'CJK-insert-space "cjkspace"
      "Insert tildes appropriately in CJK document." t)
    (defun my-LaTeX-mode-hook ()
      "My personal key definitions for LaTeX mode."
      (define-key LaTeX-mode-map " " 'CJK-insert-space))
    (add-hook 'LaTeX-mode-hook 'my-LaTeX-mode-hook)

  Please read the documentation in the file cjkspace.el .

. For Thai support please follow the instructions given in `thaifont.txt'.


DOS and OS/2 (emTeX)
--------------------

web2c has been ported to MS-DOS. If you use this (which I recommend), follow
the instructions above.

. Note that some Unix specific shell scripts and other files have names
  longer than 8 characters. You don't need them. Some of the TeX input files
  have lower and uppercase characters in its filenames, but none of the
  filenames collide under DOS.

. Move the `texinput' directory tree to a place where TeX scans for input
  files (and rename it to `cjk' or something else). Note that its
  subdirectories are specific to encoding schemes. emTeX allows for
  recursively scanned search paths, thus retaining the directory tree is
  possible.

  Example:

    CJK files:      c:\emtex\texinput\cjk\...
    environment:    set emtexdir=c:\emtex
                    set texinput=%emtexdir%\texinput!!

  See contrib/wadalab/DNP.txt for the Japanese Wadalab fonts.

. [In case you plan to use only outline fonts (PFB, TTF) you can omit
   this step.]

  Compile hbf2gf. You need GNU make and either the emx (DOS and OS/2) or
  the djgpp (DOS and Windows) compiler.

  Say `make -f Makefile.gnu' to see the possible options; more info can be
  found in hbf2gf.txt .

. Compile the utility programs.

    cc -O -s -o bg5conv bg5conv.c
    cc -O -s -o sjisconv sjisconv.c
    cc -O -s -o cefconv cefconv.c
    cc -O -s -o cef5conv cef5conv.c
    cc -O -s -o cefsconv cefsconv.c
    cc -O -s -o extconv extconv.c

. Move the various BAT files (for DOS) and/or the CMD REXX scripts (for
  OS/2) into a directory in the path (e.g., c:\emtex\bin).

. Edit the FD files of your encoding(s) to specify the fonts you have. An
  explanation of the additional size commands CJK provides can be found in
  fonts.txt .

  Note: Most FD example files from the CJK package are set up for PS fonts
  from the TeXLive distribution.

  If you use the CJK font packages (see below) no changes are needed.

. [In case you plan to use only outline fonts (PFB, TTF) you can omit this
   step.]

  If necessary, create TFM (and PK) files from CJK bitmaps with hbf2gf
  (found in utils\hbf2gf). See hbf2gf.txt and the documentation of the
  source file (hbf2gf.dvi) for explanation. Usually it is sufficient to let
  hbf2gf create a complete set of TFM files; PK fonts are then created on
  demand (this is done with the dvidrv.btm shell script of the CJK package).

  You need 4DOS or 4OS/2 (these are shareware replacements for command.com)
  to run dvidrv.btm.

  dvidrv.btm should also work with Take Command/16, Take Command/32, or Take
  Command for OS/2.

  The CJK font packages already contain TFM (and VF) files (arranged for the
  (new) TDS directory structure; unpack the font packages in the root
  directory with

    gzip -d CJK_font_archive.tgz
    tar xvf CJK_font_archive.tar

  Rearrange the directory structure as suggested below (to make the file
  search mechanism of emTeX faster) and modify the appropriate environment
  variables to include the additional directories. The same holds for the
  CJK bitmap fonts, its HBF header files and the hbf2gf configuration files.

  [Note: Binaries for the gzip and tar archive programs can be found on CTAN
   in the `utils' subdirectory.]

  Example:

      jfs56.tar.gz (should be ftp'ed as jfs56.tgz if you work under DOS
                    since two dots are not allowed)

    suggested final directory structure (after unpacking and rearranging):

      c:\texmf\fonts\tfm\gsfs1401.tfm ...
      c:\texmf\hbf2gf\gsfs14.cfg
      c:\texmf\fonts\hbf\gb2312\jfs56\jfs56.a ...
    [ c:\texmf\fonts\pk\modeless\XXXdpi\gsfs1401.pk ... ]

    Add these lines to the end of autoexec.bat:

      set texmfdir=c:\texmf
      set cjkpk=%texmfdir%\fonts\pk
      set textfm=%textfm%;%texmfdir%\fonts\tfm

    Under OS/2, add similar lines (but with expanded pathnames) to the end
    of config.sys:

      set texmfdir=c:\texmf
      set cjkpk=c:\texmf\fonts\pk
      set textfm=<your old textfm path>;c:\texmf\fonts\tfm

    Changes in gsfs14.cfg:

      pk_directory  $texmfdir\fonts\pk\modeless\432dpi\
      tfm_directory $texmfdir\fonts\tfm\

    Changes in dvidrv.btm:

      set pkdir=%texmfdir%\fonts\pk
      set ttfcfg=%texmfdir%\ttf2pk
      set hbfcfg=%texmfdir%\hbf2gf

      set pre_dpi=
      set post_dpi=dpi

    Changes in a dvi driver configuration file (.cnf) for emTeX:

      +font-files:{<your old pk path>,$texmfdir:fonts\modeless}\@Rrdpi\@f.pk

. Free Chinese TrueType fonts (for both simplified and traditiional Chinese)
  with a license similar to the GPL can be found on
  ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/nongnu and its mirrors worldwide. You might also
  search websites of companies offering WWW browser; they often come with
  CJK language packs which contain CJK TrueType fonts.

  Please note that many CJK TrueType fonts only have a Unicode mapping
  table. You should use the SFD files from the ttf2pk package starting with
  the letter `U' (e.g., UKS.sfd) which maps Unicode fonts to language
  specific encoded subfonts as needed by the CJK package.

  The ttf2pk package can be found in the contrib/ttf2pk directory of

    ftp://ftp.freetype.org/
            freetype/unstable/freetype1-contrib-current.tar.gz

  contains the two programs ttf2tfm and ttf2pk for converting TrueType fonts
  into TFM and PK fonts, respectively. By the way, this package is not
  restricted to CJK TrueType fonts; it works with other TrueType fonts too.
  Read the manual pages and the documentation for further information. For
  compilation you also need the FreeType 1 package:

    ftp://ftp.freetype.org/pub/freetype/unstable/freetype-current.tar.gz

. The font editor `fontforge' (available from http://fontforge.sf.net) is
  capable to generate Type 1 subfonts as needed by CJK from other formats
  like TTF, OTF or CID (using the subfont definition files from ttf2pk).
  Such subfonts should be usable by virtually all platforms.

  (Funnnily, fontforge uses the `.sfd' extension also for saving font files
  it creates.)

  Although fontforge needs the X Window System, it can be compiled without a
  graphical interface, using a scripting language to control font
  conversion. The directory `utils/subfonts' of the CJK package contains
  useful scripts for manipulating subfonts.

. You find the some standard Hangul PK fonts for 300dpi (cx) and 600dpi
  (ljfour) resolution in the following archives:

    han.300.tar.gz
    han1.300.tar.gz
    han.600.tar.gz
    han1.600.tar.gz
    han.tfmvf.tar.gz
    han1.tfmvf.tar.gz

  It is necessary to rearrange not only the directory structure but the
  names of the dpi directories too: The TeX directory standards specifies
  `dpiXXX', but emTeX provides by default `XXXdpi'.

  The final locations of the packages' files should be

    c:\texmf\fonts\tfm\
    c:\texmf\fonts\vf\
    c:\texmf\fonts\pk\{cx,ljfour}\XXXdpi\

  Additionally to the above example you should add this to the end of
  autoexec.bat:

    set cjkvf=%texmfdir%\fonts\vf

  or config.sys for OS/2:

    set cjkvf=c:\texmf\fonts\vf

  Assuming that you use the 300dpi Hangul PK fonts (for a cx printer) you
  should do the following changes in your dvi driver configuration file
  (suffix `.cnf') for emTeX (still continuing the above example):

    +font-files:{<your old pk path>,$texmfdir:fonts\{modeless,cx}}\@Rrdpi\@f.pk
    +virtual-fonts:{<your old vf path>,$texmfdir:fonts}\@f.vf

. For Thai support please follow the instructions given in `thaifont.txt'.


Other systems
-------------

Recent versions of CJK have only been tested with web2c; nevertheless, it
should run on other systems too:

  The font editor `fontforge' (available from http://fontforge.sf.net) is
  capable to generate Type 1 subfonts as needed by CJK from other formats
  like TTF, OTF or CID (using the subfont definition files from ttf2pk).
  Such subfonts should be usable by virtually all platforms.

  (Funnnily, fontforge uses the `.sfd' extension also for saving font files
  it creates.)

  Although fontforge needs the X Window System, it can be compiled without a
  graphical interface, using a scripting language to control font
  conversion. The directory `utils/subfonts' of the CJK package contains
  useful scripts for manipulating subfonts.

  If no outline fonts are available and you have to use HBF fonts, try to
  compile hbf2gf. Since it is written in ANSI C it should be fairly portable
  (if patches are needed please send them to the author; most likely you
  have to modify the file operating routines). If this fails it is necessary
  to build the various PK fonts on a different machine. It has been reported
  that older GNU compilers on the NeXT have difficulties with `%i'
  formatting parameters in the HBF API (hbf.c): replace all occurrences of
  `%i' with `%d'.

  If there exists an equivalent to mktexpk (or dvidrv.btm), try to modify it
  similar to CJK's changes so that CJK fonts can be created on the fly. If
  this fails you can only use precompiled sets of CJK fonts (this is, using
  PK fonts generated on another platform).

  The rest should be rather trivial for the experienced user; again, please
  write the author if you have successfully installed the package and send a
  report how to install.


How to get CJK and related software
-----------------------------------

. You find CJK and software related to TeX at the CTAN hosts (Comprehensive
  TeX Archive Network). These completely identical ftp servers (concerning
  TeX software) are

    ftp.dante.de    DANTE (Deutsche Anwendervereinigung fuer TeX)
                    Hamburg (Germany)
    ftp.tex.ac.uk   Cambridge University
                    Cambridge (England)
    ctan.tug.org    TUG (TeX Users Group)
                    Massachusetts (USA)

  You should use the nearest one, or even better, a local mirror of a CTAN
  host: The file `CTAN.sites' on CTAN contains a list.

  On CTAN, the CJK package itself is unpacked. To receive the complete
  package, go to the parent directory of CJK and say

    get CJK.zip

  or

    get CJK.tar.gz

  whatever is appropriate for your system.

  The CJK directory and all its subdirectories are sent to you in compressed
  form. Be aware that not all mirrors of CTAN sites support compression of
  directories.

. The documentation bundle of the CJK package is not unpackaged; download it
  as

    get cjk-4.8.4-doc.tar.gz

  or

    get cjk-4.8.4-doc.tar.gz cjkdoc.tgz

  whatever is appropriate for your system. It contains precompiled versions
  (in DVI, PDF, text format) of all documentation and example files.

. PostScript font packages with subfonts which can be directly used by the
  CJK package are already available on CTAN:

    traditional Chinese:
      fonts/arphic/bkai00mp-<version>.tar.gz
      fonts/arphic/bsmi00lp-<version>.tar.gz

    simplified Chinese:
      fonts/arphic/gbsn00lp-<version>.tar.gz
      fonts/arphic/gkai00mp-<version>.tar.gz

    Japanese:
      fonts/wadalab/gothic-0-13-<version>.tar.gz
      fonts/wadalab/maru-0-8-<version>.tar.gz
      fonts/wadalab/maru-1-8-<version>.tar.gz
      fonts/wadalab/mincho-0-12-<version>.tar.gz
      fonts/wadalab/mincho-0-8-<version>.tar.gz
      fonts/wadalab/mincho-1-8-<version>.tar.gz

    Korean:

  You should consult the documentation and the font samplers of those
  packages (if available) for more informations.

. Mule 2.3 can be downloaded from this Japanese host:

    ftp://ftp.m17n.org/pub/mule/mule-2.3.tar.gz

  [Note: You need Mule 2.3 only for right-to-left scripts like Arabic or
   Hebrew which aren't yet supported in emacs. Otherwise, I strongly
   recommend to get FSF emacs 22 or newer, or XEmacs 21.1 or newer which is
   available from ftp.gnu.org (USA) and ftp.xemacs.org, respectively, and
   its many mirrors.]
