##Arrow de-overlap
##arrow deoverlap
##If two arrows would overlap at their start or end, they are automatically shifted a bit to show up as separate arrow. (Note, as well, that the arrowheads follow the curvature of the arrow. The 'xmul' attribute simply makes them longer.)
box A;
space 20;
col {box B, C;}
space 20;
col {box D, E;}
use arrow.xmul=2.3;
A@e->B@w,C@w;
