          1. If you use real DNP fonts or watanabe-dnp fonts for printing,
             you should use them to preview dvi files too.

          2. If you use a Japanese Postscript printer for printing, there
             are different possibilities to preview dvi files.

             1) pk fonts.

                Because dvi files are made from dnp-tfm, you can preview the
                dvi files by real DNP fonts or watanabe-dnp fonts.

                Of course Japanese PS fonts are not exactly equal to DNP
                fonts.
                
             2) outline fonts.

                Outline fonts need less disc space than PK fonts. You can
                use outline fonts (often called vector fonts) to preview
                them.
