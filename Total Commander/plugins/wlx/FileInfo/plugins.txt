Using Plugins with fileinfo.wlx :
--------------------------------


to Users :
----------
to use plugins, you must manually edit fileinfo.ini and add a new section with new line like following

[plugins]
0=c:\Program Files\wincmd\plugins\unaspack.dll

!!! you MUST enter the complete path for this dll !!!

I supply unaspack.dll as a sample but this plugin just test for the version of aspack,
if the file you are viewing is aspack protected (eg : irfanview.exe), you'll get in 'Image File Header'

	TECHNICAL FILE INFORMATION : 
	File Type Description :	Portable Executable (PE)

	Plugin 0  :	<APK>: Executing... 
	Plugin 0  :	<APK>: File compressed with Aspack ver 2.11c/d 
	Plugin 0  :	End of Work 


However, if you own PE-explorer from heaventools (get their trial demo), you can add unupx.dll (found in 'PE Explorer\plugins' dir )
in this case, you'll get 

	TECHNICAL FILE INFORMATION : 
	File Type Description :	Portable Executable (PE)

	Plugin 1  :	Executing... 
	Plugin 1  :	<UPX> File compressed with UPX

	Plugin 1  :	<UPX> Header checksum:  Calculated  = 91h 
	Plugin 1  :	<UPX> Compressed adler32:   From Header = CDB3F22Ah 
	Plugin 1  :	<UPX> Compressed adler32:   Calculated  = CDB3F22Ah 
	Plugin 1  :	<UPX> Decompressing... 

and fileinfo will use the decompressed image of your executable in all this tabs.
