V is a tool for managing V source code.

Usage:
   v [options] [command] [arguments]

Examples:
   v hello.v                 Compile the file `hello.v` and output it as `hello` or `hello.exe`.
   v run hello.v             Same as above but also run the produced executable immediately after compilation.
   v -cg run hello.v         Same as above, but make debugging easier (in case your program crashes).
   v -o h.c hello.v          Translate `hello.v` to `h.c`. Do not compile further.

V supports the following commands:
* New project scaffolding:
   new               Setup the file structure for a V project (in a sub folder).
   init              Setup the file structure for an already existing V project.
* Ordinary development:
   run               Compile and run a V program.
   test              Run all test files in the provided directory.
   fmt               Format the V code provided.
   vet               Report suspicious code constructs.
   doc               Generate the documentation for a V module.
   vlib-docs         Generate and open the documentation of all the vlib modules.
   repl              Run the REPL.
* Installation/self updating:
   symlink           Create a symbolic link for V.
   up                Run the V self-updater.
   self [-prod]      Run the V self-compiler, use -prod to optimize compilation.
   version           Print the version text and exits.
* Module/package management:
   install           Install a module from VPM.
   remove            Remove a module that was installed from VPM.
   search            Search for a module from VPM.
   update            Update an installed module from VPM.
   upgrade           Upgrade all the outdated modules.
   list              List all installed modules.
   outdated          Show installed modules that need updates.
* Others:
   doctor            Display some usefull info about your system to help reporting bugs
   translate         Translate C code to V (coming soon in 0.3).
   tracev            Produce a tracing version of the v compiler.
                     Use `tracev yourfile.v` when the compiler panics.
                     NB: `tracev` is much slower and more verbose than ordinary `v`

Use "v help <command>" for more information about a command, example: `v help build`, `v help build-c`
Use "v help other" to see less frequently used commands.

Note: Help is required to write more help topics.
Only build, doc, fmt, run, test, search, install, remove, update, bin2v are properly documented currently.
