	* generated the BlueValues and OtherBlues entries in the Private
	dictionary using fontforge, to improve consistency of character
	heights and depths.  Other than that, the fonts are the
	same (e.g. auto-hinting remained the same as it was). The values
	were inserted with t1disasm+perl+t1asm. Suggested by Andrey V. Panov.

	* Ulrike Fischer noticed that some (rarely used) fonts mentioned
	in the map files are not available. This was due to problems when
	generating high-resolution bitmaps, but it was a mistake to
	reference missing fonts. However, rather than excluding them from
	the map files, these fonts were replaced with nearest-size
	alternative, to prevent using bitmaps. Missing fonts and their
	replacements are:

	sfbm0600 => sfbm0700
	sfbm0800 => sfbm0900
	sffb2488 => sffb2074
	sffb2986 => sffb2074
	sffb3583 => sffb2074
	sfff0500 => sfff0900
	sfff0600 => sfff0900
	sfff0700 => sfff0900
	sfff0800 => sfff0900
	sfff1728 => sfff1440
	sfff2074 => sfff2488
	sfff2986 => sfff2488
	sfff3583 => sfff2488
	sffi0500 => sffi0900
	sffi0600 => sffi0900
	sffi0700 => sffi0900
	sffi0800 => sffi0900
