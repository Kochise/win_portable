These are utility commands that you can also launch through v,
but which are used less frequently by users:

   bin2v             Convert a binary file to a v source file,
                     that can be later embedded in a module or program.

   build-examples    Test if all examples can be built.
   build-tools       Test if all tools can be built.
   build-vbinaries   Test if V can be built with different configuration.
   test-fmt          Test if all files in the current directory are formatted properly.
   test-compiler     Test if V is working properly by running all tests, including the compiler ones.
                     NB: this can take a minute or two to run

   setup-freetype    Setup thirdparty freetype on Windows.
