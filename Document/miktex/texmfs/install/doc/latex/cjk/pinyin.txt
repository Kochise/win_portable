This is the file pinyin.txt of the CJK macro package ver. 4.8.4
(18-Apr-2015).

pinyin.sty
----------

This style file (which can be also used under plain TeX) enables the input
of pinyin syllables with tones.

Say

    \usepackage{pinyin}

to load all pinyin macros under LaTeX2e; say `\input pinyin.sty' under plain
TeX.

An example explains best how to input pinyin:

    \Wo3 \hen3 \xi3\huan1 \chi1 \Zhong1\guo2 \cai4.

Note there is no fifth tone marker in pinyin (Zhuyinfuhao uses a dot to
indicate the fifth tone; on the other hand no marker is used for the first
tone). Nevertheless you can say e.g., \ne5 to get the syllable `ne' without a
tone.


There are some special cases: 

    o   use `v' instead of `u umlaut' in pinyin syllables (these are \lv,
        \lve, \nv, \nve and its uppercase forms). Example:

            \nv3'\er2       daughter

        The appearance of u umlaut with additional tone markers has been
        tested with the standard cm, ec, and PostScript fonts.

    o   use \Long and \LONG instead of \long and \Long (which you would
        expect): \long is a very important internal TeX command. Many
        packages would fail if we redefined \long.


Problems:

    The following macros are redefined if you load pinyin.sty:

        \a, \chi, \cong, \ding, \ge, \hang, \le, \min, \mu, \ne, \ni, \nu,
        \o, \O, \pi, \Pi, \Re, \tan, \xi, \Xi.

    They are available as \PY... (\PYchi, \PYcong, etc.).

    If this is not enough, you can say \PYdeactivate to restore the original
    definitions (and reactivate these syllables with \PYactivate).

    In case you use the hyperref package earlier than version 6.75a
    (2006-Feb-12) together with the `hpdftex' driver you should load
    pinyin.sty *after* hyperref.sty (contrary to what the hyperref manual
    says). Reason is that \ding is defined in pifont.sty which is
    automatically loaded by hpdftex.def -- the latest hyperref version no
    longer uses pifont.sty .
