          1. Real DNP fonts are commercial fonts sold by DNP.
             DNP Fonts are *not* PostScript fonts but PK fonts.

          2. Watanabe DNP fonts are freeware. That have same font metrics as
             real DNP Fonts but have different font names.

          3. DNP fonts are more beautiful than any available freeware fonts.
             (The book written about NTT-JTeX is printed by DNP.)

          4. NTT-JTeX uses DNP Font Metrics by default.
             dvi2ps is standard dviware for NTT-JTeX.

          5. The printer resident PostScript fonts have no relation to DNP
             fonts.

          6. But dvi2ps use `DNP Font Metrics' to drive printer resident
             PostScript fonts.

          7. Recently PostScript fonts are more used than DNP fonts since
             Japanese PostScript printers are now inexpensive in Japan.
