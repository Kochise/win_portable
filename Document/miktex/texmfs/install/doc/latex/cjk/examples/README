(1) The glyphs are rotated using the graphicx package.

(2) Font definition files for the Wadalab fonts are in the directory
    `contrib/wadalab'.

(3) For licensing reasons, TeXLive doesn't contain cyberbit.ttf and
    corresponding TeX subfont metric files, thus you can't process UTF8.tex
    without installing this font (or another Unicode font) manually.

(4) These are virtual fonts.

(5) These are bitmap fonts.

(6) Virtual Unicode fonts for Korean (from HLaTeX) are currently only
    available in the TeXLive distribution.

(7) Korean PS fonts (from HLaTeX) with glyph names compliant to the Adobe
    Glyph List (AGL) are currently only available in the TeXLive
    distribution.
