  The `fancyvrb' package provides very sophisticated facilities for reading
and writing verbatim TeX code. Users can perform common tasks like changing
font family and size, numbering lines, framing code examples, colouring text
and conditionally processing text.

  `fancyvrb' was heavily used in the typesetting of the "LaTeX Graphics
Companion", by Michel Goossens, Frank Mittelbach, Sebastian Rahtz, 
Denis Roegel, and Herbert Vo√ü,  Addison Wesley, 2007.

  It was presented March 31, 1998 for EuroTeX'98. The original paper is
available on "Cahiers GUTenberg"

keyword "fancyvrb" in the subject of the message) to <hvoss@tug.org>

  The `fancyvrb-ex' package provides some example environments to
show LaTeX code and output side by side or on top on each other.
