pbox
====

This is pbox, version 1.2.  It implements a variable-width \parbox and
some convenient length commands.  The \pbox command is equivalent to
the \parbox command, only the width specified is merely the maximum 
width; the \pbox tries to fit itself tightly around the specified text.

Installation instructions can be found in the INSTALL file.

If you are looking for a variable-width minipage environment,
I would suggest looking at the varwidth package.

You should also look into the eqparbox package, which allows you to
have a series of boxes, all with the same minimized width.

Happy Hacking.
