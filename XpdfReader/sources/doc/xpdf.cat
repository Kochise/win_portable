NAME
       xpdf - Portable Document Format (PDF) file viewer (version 4.02)

SYNOPSIS
       xpdf [options] [PDF-file [:page | +dest]] ...

       xpdf [options] -remote remote-name [command ...]

       xpdf [options] -open [PDF-file]

DESCRIPTION
       Xpdf  is a viewer for Portable Document Format (PDF) files.  (These are
       also sometimes also called 'Acrobat' files, from the  name  of  Adobe's
       PDF  software.)   Xpdf  uses the Qt GUI toolkit and runs on Unix, OS X,
       and Windows.

       To run xpdf, type:

              xpdf file.pdf

       where file.pdf is your PDF file.  The file name can be  followed  by  a
       page number to be displayed, prefixed with a colon:

              xpdf file.pdf :18

       or  by a named destination, prefixed with '+' (this is only useful with
       PDF files that provide named destination targets):

              xpdf file.pdf +destinationA

       If you specify multiple files, they will each be opened in  a  separate
       tab:

              xpdf file1.pdf file2.pdf :18 file3.pdf

       You can also start xpdf without opening any files:

              xpdf

CONFIGURATION FILE
       Xpdf reads a configuration file at startup.  It first tries to find the
       user's private config file, ~/.xpdfrc.  If that doesn't exist, it looks
       for  a  system-wide  config  file, typically /usr/local/etc/xpdfrc (but
       this location can be changed when xpdf is built).   See  the  xpdfrc(5)
       man page for details.

OPTIONS
       The  following  command  line  options are available.  All command line
       options must come before any PDF files to be opened.

       Many of the options can be set with configuration file commands.  These
       are listed in square brackets with the description of the corresponding
       command line option.

       -geometry geometry
              Set the initial window geometry.

       -title title
              Set the window title.  By default,  the  title  will  be  "xpdf:
              foo.pdf".

       -open [PDF-file]
              This option sets up a default remote server.  If Xpdf is already
              running (with the "-open" switch), the  PDF  file  (if  any)  is
              opened  in  a new tab.  If Xpdf (with the "-open" switch) is not
              already running, starts Xpdf and opens the PDF  file  (if  any).
              This  is  useful for GUI desktop environments, e.g., the typical
              double-click on a PDF file case.

       -rv    Set reverse video mode.  This reverses the colors of  everything
              except  images.  It may not always produce great results for PDF
              files which do weird things with color.  This  also  causes  the
              paper color to default to black.

       -papercolor color
              Set the "paper color", i.e., the background of the page display.
              The color can be #RRGGBB (hexadecimal) or a named  color.   This
              option  will  not  work  well with PDF files that do things like
              filling in white behind the text.  [config file: paperColor]

       -mattecolor color
              Set the matte color, i.e., the color used for background outside
              the actual page area.  The color can be #RRGGBB (hexadecimal) or
              a named color.  [config file: matteColor]

       -fsmattecolor color
              Set the matte color for full-screen  mode.   The  color  can  be
              #RRGGBB   (hexadecimal)   or   a  named  color.   [config  file:
              fullScreenMatteColor]

       -z zoom
              Set the initial zoom factor.  A number specifies a zoom percent-
              age,  where  100  means 72 dpi.  You may also specify 'page', to
              fit the page to the window size, or 'width',  to  fit  the  page
              width to the window width.  [config file: initialZoom]

       -aa yes | no
              Enable  or  disable font anti-aliasing.  This defaults to "yes".
              [config file: antialias]

       -aaVector yes | no
              Enable or disable vector anti-aliasing.  This defaults to "yes".
              [config file: vectorAntialias]

       -enc encoding-name
              Sets  the  encoding  to  use for text output.  The encoding-name
              must be defined with the  unicodeMap  command  (see  xpdfrc(5)).
              This defaults to "Latin1" (which is a built-in encoding).  [con-
              fig file: textEncoding]

       -pw password
              Specify the password for the PDF file.  This can be  either  the
              owner  password (which will bypass all security restrictions) or
              the user password.

       -fullscreen
              Open xpdf in full-screen mode, useful for presentations.

       -remote remote-name
              Start Xpdf in remote server mode.  See the  REMOVE  SERVER  MODE
              section.

       -display display
              Set the X display (only available with X11).

       -cmd   Print  commands  as  they're  executed  (useful  for debugging).
              [config file: printCommands]

       -cfg config-file
              Read config-file in place of ~/.xpdfrc or the system-wide config
              file.

       -v     Print copyright and version information.

       -h     Print usage information.  (-help and --help are equivalent.)

CONTROLS
   Toolbar
       toggle sidebar button
              Toggles (i.e., shows or hides) the sidebar.

       status indicator
              This  icon is animated while Xpdf is rendering a page.  It turns
              red when an error or warning has been issued.   Clicking  on  it
              opens the error dialog.

       selection mode
              This  icon is an "I-beam" in linear selection mode, and an arrow
              in block selection mode.  Clicking on it toggles between the two
              selection modes.

       page number entry box
              Move  to  a  specific page number.  Click in the box to activate
              it, type the page number, then hit return.   This  will  instead
              display and accept page labels, if the "view - page labels" menu
              item is checked.

       left/right arrow buttons
              Go backward or forward along the history path.

       zoom out/in buttons
              Zoom out or in (i.e., change magnification) incrementally.

       zoom popup menu
              Change the zoom factor (see the description  of  the  -z  option
              above).

       fit width button
              Change  the  zoom  factor  to  fit  the page width to the window
              width.

       fit page button
              Change the zoom factor to fit the page to the window size.

       find entry box
              Find a text string.  Click in the box to  activate  it,  type  a
              search string, then hit return.

       find next button
              Find the next occurrence of the search string.

       find previous button
              Find the previous occurrence of the search string.

       find settings button
              Display the current find settings: case sensitive (on/off), find
              whole words (on/off).

   Menu bar
       The menu bar is above the toolbar.  The  menu  items  should  be  self-
       explanatory.

   Tab list
       The tab list is on the left, just below the toolbar.  It lists all open
       tabs.

   Outline/layers/attachments pane
       This pane is on the left, below the tab list.  The popup allows you  to
       select from outline, layers, or attachments.

       The  outline  is  a tree-like structure of bookmarks that allows moving
       within the PDF file.  Not all PDF files have outlines.

       Layers (a.k.a. optional content) allow parts of the PDF content  to  be
       shown or hidden.  Not all PDF files have layers.

       Attachments  are  other files embedded within the PDF file.  There is a
       'save' button for each attached file.  Not all PDF files  have  attach-
       ments.

   Text selection
       Dragging  the  mouse  with  the left button held down will highlight an
       arbitrary rectangle.  Selected text can  be  copied  to  the  clipboard
       (with  the  edit/copy menu item).  On X11, selected text will be avail-
       able in the X selection buffer.

   Links
       When the mouse is over a hyperlink, the link target will be shown in  a
       popup near the bottom of the window.

       Clicking on a hyperlink will jump to the link's destination.  A link to
       another PDF document will make xpdf load  that  document.   A  'launch'
       link  to  an executable program will display a dialog, and if you click
       'ok', execute the program.  URL links are opened in a  system-dependent
       way.  (On UNIX, Qt uses the $BROWSER environment variable.)

   Mouse bindings
       The left mouse button is used to select text (see above).

       Clicking on a link with the middle button opens the link in a new tab.

       Dragging the mouse with the middle button held down pans the window.

       The  right  mouse  button  opens  a  popup  menu  (see  popupMenuCmd in
       xpdfrc(5)).

   Key bindings
       This section lists the default key bindings.  Bindings can  be  changed
       using the config file (see xpdfrc(5)).

       <space> or <PageDown>
              Scroll  down  on the current page; if already at bottom, move to
              next page.

       control-<PageDown> or control-<down-arrow>
              Go to the next page.  If <ScrollLock> is active, this  maintains
              the relative position on the page.

       <PageUp>
              Scroll up on the current page; if already at top, move to previ-
              ous page.

       control-<PageUp> or control-<up-arrow>

Full-screen mode
       Xpdf  can  be  placed into full-screen mode via the -fullscreen command
       line option,  the  'full  screen'  menu  item,  or  a  binding  to  the
       fullScreenMode or toggleFullScreenMode command.

       Entering  full-screen  mode  automatically switches to single-page view
       mode and to the fit-page zoom factor.

       Full-screen mode can be exited via the default <esc>  key  binding,  or
       via a binding to the windowMode or toggleFullScreenModecommand.

COMMANDS
       Xpdf's key and mouse bindings are user-configurable, using the bind and
       unbind commands in the config file (see xpdfrc(5)).  The  bind  command
       allows  you  to bind a key or mouse button to a sequence of one or more
       commands.

       The following commands are supported:

       about  Open the 'about' dialog.

       blockSelectMode
              Set block selection mode.  In this mode, the selection is a sim-

       run(external-command-string)
              Run  an  external command.  The following escapes are allowed in
              the command string:

                  %f => PDF file name (or an empty string if no
                        file is open)
                  %b => PDF file base name, i.e., file name minus
                        the extension (or an empty string if no
                        file is open)
                  %u => link URL (or an empty string if not over
                        a URL link)
                  %p => current page number (or an empty string if
                        no file is open)
                  %x => selection upper-left x coordinate
                        (or 0 if there is no selection)
                  %y => selection upper-left y coordinate
                        (or 0 if there is no selection)
                  %X => selection lower-right x coordinate
                        (or 0 if there is no selection)
                  %Y => selection lower-right y coordinate
                        (or 0 if there is no selection)
                  %i => page containing the mouse pointer
                  %j => x coordinate of the mouse pointer
                  %k => y coordinate of the mouse pointer
                  %% => %

              The external command string will often contain  spaces,  so  the
              whole command must be quoted in the xpdfrc file:

                  bind x "run(ls -l)"

              The command string may not be run through a shell.  It is recom-
              mended to keep the command simple, so that it doesn't depend  on
              specific  shell functionality.  For complex things, you can have
              the command string run a shell script.

              ber (on separate lines).  This file can be loaded later with the

REMOTE SERVER MODE
       Starting  xpdf  with  the  "-remote"  switch puts it into remote server
       mode.  All remaining command line options are commands  (see  the  COM-
       MANDS section).  Subsequent invocations of "xpdf -remote" with the same
       remote server name will send commands to the  already-running  instance
       of  xpdf.  The "checkOpenFile" commands are useful here for things like
       changing pages.  For example:

                  # Start up xpdf, and open something.pdf.
                  xpdf -remote foo 'openFile(something.pdf)'

                  # Switch to page 7 in the  already-open  something.pdf.   If
              the user
                  #  has closed xpdf in the meantime, this will restart it and
              reopen
                  # the file.
                  xpdf -remote foo 'checkOpenFileAtPage(something.pdf, 7)'
