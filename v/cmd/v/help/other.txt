These are utility commands that you can also launch through v,
but which are used less frequently by users:

   bin2v             Convert a binary file to a v source file,
                     that can be later embedded in a module or program.

   build-examples    Test if all examples can be built.
   build-tools       Test if all tools can be built.
   build-vbinaries   Test if V can be built with different configuration.
   test-fmt          Test if all files in the current directory are formatted properly.
   test-compiler     Test if V is working properly by running all tests, including the compiler ones.
                     NB: this can take a minute or two to run
   test-parser       Test that the V parser works with the given files, as if
                     they were typed by a human programmer, one character at a time.
                     NB: *very slow* for longer files (tens of seconds for 1KB .v file).
                     Mainly useful as a parser bug finder for the V Language Server project.

   setup-freetype    Setup thirdparty freetype on Windows.
